Summary
As one of the technical partner, WorldFish is mainly promoting nutrition-sensitive fish and
vegetable production systems for the beneficiary households of ‘Suchana’ program led by Save
the Children and other consortium partners including WorldFish, HKI, IDE, icddr,b, CNRS, FIVDB
and RDRS. Suchana has adopted an integrated approach delivering both nutrition specific and
nutrition sensitive interventions to prevent chronic malnutrition within the critical first 1,000 days
of a child’s life. The goal of the 6-year program is to reduce childhood stunting by 6% in 250,000
very poor households in Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts. It is anticipated that 30% of the
beneficiary households would have access to ponds or other small water-bodies and would
receive support on nutrition-sensitive fish production along with other nutrition-sensitive and
nutrition-specific program components. Nutrition-sensitive fish and vegetable production
interventions focused mainly on carp-tilapia polyculture along with the production of small
indigenous fish species (SiS) and different types of vegetables. The main aim of the interventions
is to increase the production and consumption of fish and vegetables to enhance dietary diversity
of women of reproductive age and young children of 6 to 23 months of age.
But considering the expectations from the beneficiary households (BHHs) especially those have
access to smaller portion of pond (less than 2 decimals of water area) per BHH, WorldFish is also
promoting an integrated supports through incorporating the small-scale poultry rearing along with
existing nutrition-sensitive aquaculture and vegetable production systems.
Based on the study findings, there was also very encouraging progress in production and use of
fish, poultry (chicken and duck), eggs and vegetables at the beneficiary households those
received integrated supports from Suchana. Beneficiary households have harvested on an
average 9.1 Kg of fish, 154 Kg of vegetables, 5.4 pieces of poultry birds (chicken and duck) and
50.5 numbers of eggs during past 6 months. More than ninety percent (95%) of harvested fish,
58% of vegetable, 61% of poultry birds and 67% of eggs were used for family consumption. Still,
84.4% of the beneficiary’s ponds had average 12.9 Kg of fish (estimated bio-mass), 6.5 number
of poultry birds either chicken or ducks or combination of both in addition to the vegetables at the
gardens. All together the value of the overall fish (including the bio-mass) and poultry products
were 8,036 taka based on the local market prices; of which the value of total fish was estimated
as 3,880 taka, poultry birds was as 3,626 taka and eggs was as 530 taka per beneficiary
households. I addition to that the value of harvested vegetables was 3,538 taka. Out of that the
cash income from the vegetables was 1,146 taka per households and those money were spent
for children’s education (74%), purchasing other food items (68%), productive activities (68%)
like veg gardening, poultry rearing, Aquaculture and others, purchasing medicine (38%), clothes
(32%), savings (24%), home appliances (18%), housing/ house repairing (12%), repaying loans
(9%), purchasing furniture (6%) and some other (9%).

Almost entire (98%) households were either satisfied (77%) or very satisfied (21%) after receiving
the integrated supports including aquaculture and poultry rearing in addition to the vegetable
production system. Only 2% of the BHHs mentioned their neutral impression about the integrated
supports, and they were neither satisfied nor unsatisfied. The BHHs also mention that it enhanced
the access of more diversified food (73%), generated opportunity for more production (59%) and
more profits (63%), better use of resources like ditch/ small pond (26%) and better use of their
skills (2%). Only 3% of the households mentioned that it was challenging to manage more
components together.

From the enhanced production of fish, poultry bird, eggs and vegetables, there was also very
strong reflection on the dietary diversity of reproduction age women and 6 to 23 months of

                                                                                                     i

children. Almost three-fifth (57.8%) of the reproductive age women and two-third (64.7%) of the
children (6 to 23 months) had diversified diets after one year since receiving the intervention from
Suchana; although the number of sample households wasn’t adequate for statistical validation.

At the same time, they also faced some challenges related to their production practices.
Therefore, further attention should be required to improve their production systems to enhance
the production practices especially ensuring the availability of quality fingerling at the community
levels, improving the poultry shed and strengthening the coverage of vaccination for poultry birds.

1. Background
Suchana: Ending the cycle of undernutrition in Bangladesh is a multi-sectoral nutrition program
that aims to achieve a significant reduction in stunting amongst children under two years of age
in Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts of Bangladesh by catalyzing support across government and
other stakeholders. Suchana has adopted an integrated approach delivering both nutrition
specific and nutrition sensitive interventions to prevent chronic malnutrition within the critical first
1,000 days of a child’s life. The program is led by Save the Children and involves WorldFish, HKI,
IDE, icddr,b, CNRS, FIVDB and RDRS as consortium partners. DFID and the European Union
are providing the financial support.

WorldFish is mainly promoting nutrition-sensitive fish and vegetable production systems to the
beneficiary households (BHHs) of the Suchana program. The Suchana program has a phased
approach where each union receives intensive support for the first year, technical and behavioral
change support in the second year, and follow-up and monitoring in the third year. A total of
250,000 beneficiary households from 157 unions (20 upazilas) will receive support through 4
phases (years) over the project period from 2015 to 2022. It is anticipated that 30% of beneficiary-
households would have access to ponds or other small water-bodies and would receive support
on nutrition-sensitive fish production along with vegetable production and behavioral change
messaging on nutrition. This includes technical training, coaching, inputs (lime, fish fingerlings
and fish feed for fish culture; seeds, seedlings and cuttings for vegetables), and linkages with
local market actors and service providers from both public and private sectors. Fish production
focuses mainly on carp and tilapia poly-culture along with small indigenous fish species (SiS)
using improved management practices. Considering the expectations from the beneficiary
households (BHHs) especially those have access to smaller pond (less than 2 decimals of water
area), WorldFish is also promoting an integrated supports to strengthen the nutrition-sensitive
vegetable, fish and poultry production systems at the beneficiary households of Suchana using
the same amount of financial supports for single component either aquaculture or poultry rearing
only. It is expected that these integrated support will create better outcomes through enhancing
the household food production system and dietary diversity of the women and children less than
two years of age.

Up to March 2019, a total 1,801 BHHs (only at phase 2 working unions) have received both the
aquaculture and poultry related supports besides the common horticulture package including
training and primary inputs. Out of the 1,801 beneficiary households, 547 are at CNRS, 836 at
FIVDB and 418 at RDRS working areas. This is one of the especial initiatives as pilot, therefore
senior management of Suchana consortium has been recommended to conduct a rapid
assessment to capture the level of outcomes from the interventions of integrated support.



1.1 Objectives of the study
The main objective of the study to document the overall performance of interventions related to
the integrated supports on aquaculture, horticulture and poultry rearing. It is expected that the
study will mainly focus the production of fish, vegetables and poultry (chicken & ducks), and their
uses towards increasing production of diverse nutritious food for family consumption and
additional income by selling the surplus produces along with few other relevant indicators.




                                                                                                      1

1.2 Specific objectives of the study
   To analyze the trends towards increasing the production, consumption and sales of fish,
    vegetables, and poultry birds and eggs produced at the beneficiary households of Suchana;
   To capture the dietary diversity among the households including women and children less
    than 2 years of age;
   To identify the strengths and challenges faced by the households are involved in integrated
    supports related to aquaculture, horticulture and poultry rearing components;
   To explore the overall learning and the future potentialities of fish, horticultural and poultry
    activities for the intervention communities;


2. Methodology
It was mainly a quantitative survey based rapid assessment. A set of well-structured
questionnaire have been used for the survey focusing the mainly quantitative indicators along
with some categorical indicators too capture some qualitative insights from the beneficiary
households. As there was no baseline assessment of these households, no comparisons have
been presented with the current findings.

2.1 Sample design
Considering the limitation of financial and human resources and management decisions, a total
sample of ninety (90) beneficiary households (BHHs) those received the integrated package have
been interviewed for the study. A total thirty (30) BHHs were selected from each of the
implementing partners’ working areas. Simple random sampling technique was followed to select
the 30 BHHs from each of the implementing partners’ working areas.

2.2 Process of the study
Considering the limitation of resources, existing technical team members from WorldFish and
Helen Keller International (HKI) have collected the primary data and relevant information from
the field. They have taken necessary supports from respective team members from other
technical partners and implementing partners at the field levels. Data analyst of Suchana,
WorldFish was responsible to develop the data entry package, enter the data and primary
processing. M& E Specialist of Suchana from WorldFish is responsible to lead the overall the
study including the preparing concept note, tools (questionnaires and check lists), capacity
building, final data processing and analysis, and developing the reports. The team has also
received the necessary guidance, review and editing supports from the Project Manager/ team
leaders and other senior team members of Suchana and WorldFish including the senior team
members from Save the Children, UK. Besides the primary information, available secondary
information from the existing documents, database and relevant publications have also been
used for the study.

2.3 Limitation of the study
The sample size is only 90 intervention households for quantitative data. So it is not the
statistically validated number of sample. Moreover, no baseline is available to compare the
current findings. Still, it is expected that it will give the good lessons for the program team and
senior management about the progress towards achieving the intendent outcomes of Suchana.
It can also be a good learning document to improve the future initiatives and decision making.

                                                                                                  2

3. Results and discussion


3.1 Dietary diversity of reproductive age women including the mothers
Figure 1 shows that more than half (57.8%) of the reproductive age women including the mothers
of the children less than 2 years of age at the beneficiary households of integrated support had
diversified diets after one year since receiving the intervention of Suchana.

3.2 Dietary diversity of 6 to 23 month old children
Almost two-third (64.7%) of the children (6-23 months old) had more diverse complementary
feeding after the intervention of integrated support. It is very encouraging progress although
number of sample wasn’t adequate for statistical validation.

Using the integrated supports, beneficiary households have harvested on an average 9.1 Kg of
fish in past 6 months and 95% of those were used for family consumption. But it was the partial
harvest and most (84.4%) of the ponds had fish and the estimated amount of fish (biomass) per
respondent household was 12.9 Kg. All together their estimated production is 21.9 Kg per
household. Besides the aquaculture, the households also received supports on poultry rearing
which included chicken or duck based interest and local feasibility of individual households. From
the poultry rearing 5.4 pieces of poultry birds were used in past 6 months and 61% of the birds
were used for family consumption. Still they had 6.5 number of poultry birds either chicken or
ducks or combination of both.

Based one figure 3, the value of harvested fish was 1,583 taka per BHH and they had estimated
value worth of the fish in the pond was 2,297 taka per BHH. All together the value of total fish
was estimated as 3,880 Taka per household based on local market price.

The value of the uses poultry birds was 1,616 Taka per households, and they had 6.5 birds (table
1) which had also the value of 2,010 Taka. So, total value of poultry birds was 3,626 Taka based
on the local market price. Similarly, each of the households collected 50.5 eggs in past 6 months;
from those 34 were used for family consumption and that was 67% of the production. Other 20%
of the eggs were gifted to the relatives and neighbors, and 13% (6.4) was used for hatching new

chicks or ducklings. But selling of the produces was very negligible for both the fish and poultry
products (table 1). However, each of the beneficiary households of integrated support model used
the products of 3,707 taka and they had the products of 4,329 taka. Altogether, the value of the
overall fish and poultry products were 8,036 taka based on the local market prices.

4.1 Pond profile and aquaculture practices

  Water Area                             5.9                               1.8

Table 2 shows, the average pond size and water area per ponds along with the share of the pond
area for the respondent households. The average pond size and water area of the pond per
beneficiary were very low. Water area per beneficiary households was only 1.8 decimal..


4.1.2 Aquaculture practices
Table 3 shows the fish culture practices used in the ponds; 83% of the beneficiary households
followed ‘carp-tilapia polyculture using improved aquaculture practices (including SiS)’ and
remaining 17% of the beneficiary households ‘carp-tilapia polyculture using traditional
aquaculture practices (including SiS)’.

Table 3: Proportion (%) of BHHs used aquaculture technologies
  Type of technologies                                                           % of BHH
                                                                                   n=90
  Carp-tilapia poly-culture using traditional practices (including SiS)             17
  Carp-tilapia poly-culture using improved practice (including SiS)                 83

Usually, ‘carp-tilapia polyculture using traditional practices’ represents the aquaculture practice
where farmers release only fingerlings. Usually, they do not prepare the pond following the
recommend practices; do not use necessary feed and other improved practices. On the other
hand, ‘carp-tilapia polyculture using improved practices’ is using the improved technological
practices at all the levels like pond preparation, using limes and fertilizers, stocking quality
fingerling from reliable sources, and ensuring regular feeding practices through maintaining water
quality. These practices are very effective to increase the pond productivity.

4.1.3 Major challenges in aquaculture
Figure 4 shows the major challenges faced by the beneficiary households related to aquaculture.

During the survey, a higher proportion of housheolds mentioned joint ownership ponds (32%),
lack of money (26%), lack of water during dry season (19%), technical knowledge (12%), Low
level of water in homestead ponds (12%), Lack of sunlight at the pond water (10%), High turbid
water during flood and rainy season (9%), Unavailability of desired fingerlings (6%) and some
others (10%). But 22% of the housheolds didn’t mention any challenge.

4.2 Vegetable gardening practices
Vegetable gardening is a traditional agricultural activity in rural Bangladesh and vegetables have
a very important role in human diets as a source of valuable micronutrients (FPMU, 2014).
Considering its importance, vegetable production has been one of the common interventions
recommended for all beneficiary households in Suchana.

About 89% households had active vegetable gardens after 1 year of intervention and almost all
(98.9%) had one within the past 6 month. The usual locations for these gardens were homestead
land (78%), nearby crop field (39%), roadsides (20%) and pond dikes (13%).

Figure 4 shows that a larger proportion (58%) of harvested vegetables was used for family
consumption averaging 89 kg. Some of the vegetables like 14 kg (9% of total harvest) were gifted
to their relatives and neighbors, and one third of the harvest (50 kg) was sold. The average
income was 1,146 taka per household in past 6 months. The estimated value of the average
harvest was 3,538 taka per households in past 6 months.

Figure 6 shows the major challenges faced by the beneficiary housheolds of integrated support
especially regaring their vegetable production. Around one third of respondents mentioned about
irrigation problem (36%), excessive rainning (34%), lack of qualiy seeds (31%), and flood and
drainage problems (27%). Other challenges were lack of pesticides/ pest control (13%), lack of
techncal skills (10%), exceessive drought (8%), less amount of seeds (6%) and some other
(19%). Only 7% of the respondednt didn’t raise any challenge.



4.3 Homestead poultry rearing practices
Homestead poultry rearing is also one of the very traditional practices for rural Bangladesh
including Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts. In recent decades, commercial poultry has grown
dramatically though intensive rearing practices. Still, local poultry has huge demand in the market
and price is also 40% to 60% higher compared to the broiler chicken. But they face a number of
constraints and limitations during rearing the local chickens- attacking of diseases, higher
mortality due to poor rearing practices and diseases, loss by the predators, and less production
in terms of size and number of eggs, and meat per bird compared to the commercial once.

Besides the number of constraints and limitations, there are many advantages in rearing of local
chickens, such as immune capacity is stronger than hybrid or improved chicken, scavenging and
semi-scavenging rearing is possible, easy adoptable in rural environment, new chickens can be
hatched at the household levels, feeding and rearing costs are comparatively lower, market
demand is higher, easy to sell, and sustainable rearing practices.

Almost all (97%) of the respondent households had poultry rearing either chicken (92%) or duck
(37%), or both (32%).




                                                                                                 8

4.3.1 Poultry rearing practices
Figure 7 shows that one-third (34%) of the integrated support BHHs followed semi-scavenging
poultry rearing practices and almost two-third BHHs of followed scavenging rearing practices.
Only 1% BHHs followed confined rearing practice.

More than two-fifth (42%) of the households didn’t have any separate poultry shed and more than
a quarter (27%) of the households had traditional poultry shed made by mud and straw or similar
other materials. Only 3% of BHHs had poultry shed where chicks may possible to separate from
the hens where as 13% BHHs had poultry shed with sound roof and 17% BHHs had poultry shed
with well-ventilation facilities. Only 4% BHHs had portable improved poultry shed, and 6% had
other facilities of poultry shed like bamboo baskets locally called polo.

Overall 67% of the respondent households hatched poultry bird using local broody hens in past
6 months. Out of those, 66% households produced chicks and only 6% households produced
ducklings. On an average total 14,4 numbers of birds were hatched per households; of which
13.7 were chicks and only 0.6 were ducklings. But overall survival rate of the birds was 58%, and
that was 57% for chicks and 89% for ducklings (figure 9).

4.3.4 Status of vaccination
Ensuring of the regular vaccination of poultry bird since day old chick, outbreak of many diseases
can be prevented. Based on the findings, more than one third (36%) of BHHs used vaccination
for their poultry and 35% was from Suchana vaccinators. Only 2% households used poultry
vaccination from private/ local vaccinators or other sources.

Based on figure 11, attacking of disease was the major problem faced by the respondent
households. The major four challenges were related to diseases or death of poultry bird due to
‘outbreak of highly contagious infections & endemic diseases’ (39%), disease outbreak in winter
season causing heavy cold injuries’ (16%), death of poultry caused by natural disasters (flood,
cyclones, etc. 15%)’, ‘poultry disease caused by excessively high temperature (8%)’. Other
constraints were ‘non-availability of quality vaccination and medicine’ (6%), ‘non-availability of
trained & experienced veterinary service provider in locality’ (4%) along with few others (8%). It
is also important that more than a quarter (26%) of BHHs mentioned that they didn’t face any
major problems. Most of these problems may be reduced through regular vaccination following
the recommended schedule and improving the poultry shed, use of supplementary feeding and
other improved rearing practices including the biosecurity.

Figure 12 shows that almost entire (98%) households were either satisfied (77%) or very satisfied
(21%) after receiving the integrated supports including aquaculture and poultry rearing in addition
to the vegetable production system. Only 2% BHH mentioned their neutral impression about the
integrated supports, and they were neither satisfied nor unsatisfied

The enumerators also collected the reasons behind their impression about the level of satisfaction
or dis-satisfactions about the integrated supports of Suchana. Highest proportion (73%) of the
BHHs of integrated support had mentioned that this supports has given them “More diversified
food for us”; they also mention the other reasons which were “More profitable for us” (63%), “More
production opportunities for us” (59%), “Better use of resources like ditch/ pond” (26%) and
“Better use of our skills” (2%). Only 3% of the households mentioned, it was “Challenging to
manage more components together”.

5. Conclusion
Using the very small resources per household, there was very encouraging progress in
production and use of fish, poultry (chicken and duck), eggs and vegetables at the beneficiary
households those integrated supports from Suchana. They produced diversified species fish,
considerable numbers of eggs and wider varieties of vegetables; and more importantly most of
their production they used for their family consumption. It has also strong reflections on dietary
diversity of reproductive age women and 6 to 23 months of children. Despite high level of
satisfaction in doing aquaculture, poultry rearing and vegetable cultivation in the very limited
areas, the BHHs also faced some challenges regarding their production practices. Therefore,
further attention should be required to improve their production practices to enhance the
production practices especially ensuring of the quality fingerling at the community levels,
improving the poultry shed and strengthening the coverage of vaccination of poultry birds
following the recommended vaccination schedules.
