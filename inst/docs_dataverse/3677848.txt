1. Introduction
Fish consumption has significantly contributed to the food and nutrition security of poor and
undernourished people in Myanmar (LIFT, 2016). Ensuring adequate availability of fish and
its accessibility is critical to ensure food and nutrition security in Myanmar, where 33% of
children are stunted and 25% of children are underweight (UNICEF, 2012). In addition, more
than 80% of children especially those less than two year-old and 70% of pregnant women are
anemic (LIFT, 2016). At national level, 10% of population live under the national food
poverty line, which is based on the minimum level of food expenditure of a consumption
basket that is needed to satisfy the calorie requirements of the households (UNDP, 2011).

   Aquaculture has the potential to contribute to reducing poverty, improving food security,
and alleviating malnutrition situation in Myanmar. It is one of the main livelihood strategies
and a source of fish for 48-52% of households. It constitutes 21% of total national fresh fish
consumption. Fish and its products are also the major animal source of food for about half of
the population and is consumed by nearly all households in Myanmar (Belton et al., 2015). It
accounts for a significant proportion of household food expenditure (14%), only a little below
the staple rice (19%). In addition to supplying the major source of animal protein, aquaculture
in Myanmar also has the potential to be a major source of employment. It generates nearly
double the amount of employment per hectare of paddy farming (Belton et al., 2015).
Moreover, aquaculture has the potential to meet the increase in demand for farmed fish given
the likely increase in income in Myanmar. Studies show that the farmed fish consumption per
capita increases nearly twice as much (34%) as that of other fish consumption (16%) as we
move up along the household expenditure quantile.

   Fish farming in developing countries is still largely based on unimproved fish strains
which are genetically similar or inferior to wild counterparts (Brummett et al., 2004; Ponzoni
et al., 2007). There are only a few examples where aquaculture production has benefited from
genetically improved strains (Gjedrem, 2012). This results in aquaculture with poor growth
rate, high mortality, and high production costs. Genetically improved seeds of fish and other
aquatic species are essential for increasing productivity and improving socio-economic
performance of aquaculture production (Ponzoni et al., 2007; Yosef, 2009). Due to the
importance of tilapia in aquaculture in developing countries, WorldFish and partners in
Philippines and Norway undertook the Genetic Improvement of Farmed Tilapia (GIFT)
project in late 1980s with funding provided by the United Nations Development Program and

                                                                                                 1

the Asian Development Bank (Dey et al., 2000). As an outcome of this project, an improved
tilapia strain with faster growth, known as the GIFT strain was created. These gains need to
be supported by research that can catalyze their acceptance, and especially among small-scale
farmers that often are the last to benefit from these gains, and where private sector business
incentives to supply improved seed are more limited. Thus, to expand the adoption of
improved tilapia strains, it is necessary to conduct an integrated assessment to evaluate its
performance, economic viability, social acceptability, environmental compatibility, and
overall impact under varied agro-ecological systems and socioeconomic environments.

   Myanmar is one of the world‚Äôs major aquaculture producing countries, but the technical
and socioeconomic characteristics of aquaculture in Myanmar has not been adequately
studied compared with the other major fish farming countries in Asia (FAO, 2016). Myanmar
is a country where the major household diet share of energy comes from rice consumption
and that of animal protein and micronutrients comes from fish consumption. This leads to a
fast-growing demand for fish as the country urbanizes and increases in income. Since the
change of government that took place in 2012, new agricultural policy promotes the
diversification of smallholder agriculture for high-return crop, including fish farming, as a
vehicle for poverty reduction and rural development (NESAC, 2016). Moreover, Department
of Fisheries in Myanmar has been trying to introduce new technologies and fish species to
augment fish production to meet the demand for fish in the present and in the near future
(DOF, 2017). Before introducing new technologies or species, it is very important to know
the potential impact they will have on the target groups. This includes not only the more
direct effect on production and income, but also the indirect effect on the livelihood of the
farmers, such as food security, welfare, environmental quality, and gender balance in the
decision making processes of a household.




2. Research design
   2.1. Study area

The Ayeyarwady region was selected as the study area because it is the main fish farming
region in Myanmar. As the focus of the project is on smallholder fish farmers and pond
management practices are important in the success of tapping the full potential of GIFT, the
participating households consist of smallholder fish farmers who have participated in another


                                                                                                 2

WorldFish project ‚ÄúPromoting the sustainable growth of aquaculture in Myanmar (MYFC)‚Äù.
These smallholder fish farmers received training on best farming practices in the past few
years but will not be receiving any intervention from MYFC during the duration of the
current project. Therefore, the difference in treatment received by the project farmers during
the study will only be through the current project and not any other projects.

   2.2. Sample size and random assignment

Assuming a type-I error probability, Œ±, of 0.05, and statistical power, 1-Œ≤, of 0.8, the sample
size should be:

                                                   2   ùë† 2
                             ùëÅ = 2 √ó (ùëß1‚àíùõº + ùëß1‚àíùõΩ ) √ó ( )

                                                       ùë† 2
                             ùëÅ = 2 √ó (1.96 + 0.84)2 √ó ( )
                                                       ùõø0

with s being the standard deviation of the outcome variable in the baseline population and Œ¥0
being the treatment effect on the outcome variable. In the socioeconomic aspect of the
analysis, a main outcome variable is food security. According to the Integrated Household


                                                                                                  3

Living Conditions Survey in Myanmar (UNDP, 2011), the food-poverty line for Myanmar
was 274,990 Kyat per capita per year in 2010. Note that this is the amount needed to meet the
caloric requirement only and does not take into consideration the diversity and quality of the
diet.




                        Figure 2. Houses and ponds in the study area




                                                                                                 4

The standard deviation of annual per capita food expenditure for one of the townships in the
study area, Pyapon, was 203,637 Kyat in 2015 based on the Myanmar Poverty and Living
Conditions Survey by the World Bank (2015). Assuming that the increase in fish farming
income can help pay for three months of basic caloric requirement in a year, the sample size
for each treatment arm would be 138. As the food-poverty line captures only the caloric
requirement of food consumption, we analyze also the diet diversity using the household diet
diversity score (HDDS). The standard deviation of HDDS for the Pyapon township was 1.676
based on data by the World Bank (2015). As fish is the major animal source food for only
half of the population, assuming that the intervention increases HDDS by half a food group
on average, the sample size for each treatment arm would be 176. In order to account for
potential attrition during the endline, we decided on a treatment group with 200 households.
From the list of fish farmers who have agreed to participate in the project, we randomly
assigned 200 households to the treatment group and the rest of the households (243) were
assigned to the control group. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the treatment and control
households in the three townships of the study area: Dedaye, Kyaik Lat, and Pyapon.

3. Baseline survey
   3.1. Survey questionnaire and preparation

The survey questionnaire was drafted in late 2018. During the project inception workshop in
2019 held at the WorldFish headquarter in Penang, Malaysia from February 14 to February
15, work plans and the draft questionnaire were discussed and finalized. From March 4 to
March 9, the project team visited the GIFT hatchery in Shwebo, Myanmar, and pretested the
draft questionnaire by conducting household survey of fish farmers in Madaya, which is
located about 100 km away from Shwebo.

                                                                                              6

       Figure 6. Harvesting of farmed fish at a pretest household in Madaya, Myanmar

   Based on the experience and feedback obtained during the pretest, the questionnaire was
further refined. In order for an integrated performance analysis to be conducted, the data
collected must capture the different aspects of fish farming and the livelihoods of the farmers.
In addition to the technical performance of the fish operation, we also need a series of other
socioeconomic indicators, such as food security and women involvement in the livelihood
activities of fish farming. The final draft of the questionnaire consists of the following
modules: household member characteristics; details of aquaculture production including
amount and sources of inputs, revenue, expenses, labor composition, harvest use, fish
mortality rate, and management practices; perception and adaptation to climatic shocks; food
security and diet diversity; food safety and certification; access to information and credit; risk
preference; household expenditure; asset and housing conditions; and subjective wellbeing.
For examining the participation of different genders in aquaculture, questions about the main
decision makers in pond management and harvest use, and labor composition in major fish
farming activities were also included.

   The questionnaire was then translated into the Burmese language and programmed into
Open Data Kit (ODK), as the survey data would be collected via a mobile data collection
platform. The electronic version of the questionnaire was then tested by the team members
and problems were addressed before enumerator training started.




                                                                                                 7

   3.2. Training of supervisors and enumerators

After the questionnaire was finalized, a training session was held in Pyapon, Myanmar from
April 29 to May 6, 2019. The trainees included thirteen enumerators, with most of them
having previous experience in conducting household survey for WorldFish. The session was
led by five project team members from WorldFish and Hohenheim University. A field
coordinator and two members from WorldFish Myanmar and MYFC also helped in
organizing the session and acting as translator.




       Figure 7. Training session of supervisors and enumerators in Pyapon, Myanmar



                                                                                             8

   The session was split into three parts. The first part lasted four days and concentrated on
explaining the survey and questionnaire in details to the enumerators using the paper version
of the questionnaire. A major amount of time was also dedicated to role-play, so that the
participants were familiar with asking the questions and in anticipating potential problems.
During the session, participants also made suggestions on how the questionnaire could be
improved. After the participants were familiar with the paper version of the questionnaire,
they were trained on how to collect data by using tablet. The next two days were spent on
familiarizing themselves with the tablet and the ODK platform. After that, the final two days
of training were allocated for conducting pilot survey in some nearby villages. This was to
give the enumerators an opportunity to collect data using tablet in an actual setting. The
households visited during this part of the training were not part of the project households.

   3.3. Field survey

The training and the pilot survey ended on May 6, 2019. The enumerators had a day off on
the next day, May 7. It gave the project team the opportunity to finalize the survey instrument
and fix the problems that occurred during the pilot. The field survey officially started on May
8, 2019. The field team consisted of a field coordinator and 11 members. From the 13
participants in the training session, one was not selected for the final team due to
unsatisfactory performance during training and one had to leave due to last-minute changes to
his other work commitment. Two of the remaining 11 members were chosen to be
supervisors and the rest were split into two groups. Therefore, the final field team consisted
of a field coordinator, a group with one supervisor and five enumerators, and another group
with one supervisor and four enumerators.

   The field survey ran from May 8 to July 20. Before the enumerators visited the
households, the field coordinator arranged the logistics and called the farmers to confirm their
participation and to ask for a time that was suitable for them to be interviewed. The
supervisors also met with the village authorities and went to the villages with the enumerators
on the day of the survey. Despite the prior arrangements made by the field coordinator, there
were times when households could not be interviewed as scheduled due to unforeseen
circumstances, such as illness, last-minute changes to farmers‚Äô availability, or bad weather
conditions that massively delayed enumerators‚Äô travel to the villages. In these cases, the field
coordinator rescheduled the interview with the households and the enumerators revisited the
households at the end of the survey period in July. From the list of smallholder fish farmers


                                                                                                 9

provided by MYFC, about 15% of them could not be interviewed because they have migrated
or have stopped fish farming activities due to old age or destroyed ponds. At the end of the
survey, a total of 443 smallholder fish farming households were successfully interviewed.




    Figure 8. Field survey with some households only accessible by log bridge or by boat

   In order to ensure the quality of data collected, a doctoral student from Hohenheim
University followed the survey team to the villages to address issues related to the
questionnaire or the use of tablet in the field. After the team returned from the villages at the
end of each survey day, she worked with the field team and a member of WorldFish
Myanmar to discuss the issues that occurred during the day and how to deal with them. The
field team then uploaded the data collected to the server at the end of each survey day. The
other project members from WorldFish headquarter and Hohenheim University (the off-field
team) downloaded the data and checked for any potential mistakes or outliers. Any issues
detected were conveyed to the field coordinator and the doctoral student, and they worked
with the enumerators to solve the problems. This was done usually by checking the notes
taken by the enumerators during the household interview. If this was not enough to solve the

                                                                                                10

problem, the enumerator would call the household to confirm the information and verify the
data. Any corrections made were then conveyed to the off-field team, so that the dataset
could be cleaned accordingly.




4. Baseline survey results
For the analysis, the households are split into terciles based on their total pond size: small,
medium, and large. Note that the project focuses on smallholder fish farmers and the
categorization used in this analysis is only relative to the other households in the study.
Therefore, households in the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù group are also smallholders and not big-scale fish
farmers. The comparison across pond size groups allows us to examine the level of
intensification of the farming system among smallholders based on the characteristics of
aquaculture in the last production cycle such as inputs, harvest, and practices applied. Two-
sample t-test is used to compare the means of all three potential pairings: small and medium,
small and large, and medium and large.

 Large group (> 0.0410 ha)                   0.0990              144                32.73



   4.1. Aquaculture production

Households in the large group stocked twice as many and households in the medium group
stocked 1.5 times more than those in the small group. These differences were statistically
significant. Moreover, the significantly lower stocking for the small group was similarly
observed at the species level (rohu, pangasius, and silver barb). This was not surprising, as a
bigger pond could accommodate more fingerlings. A more interesting aspect was that there
was a reverse trend for the stocking density per hectare of pond size, as the stocking density
per hectare was the highest among the households in the small group, compared with the
households in the medium and large groups. The same pattern was observed in the stocking
density of the most common species, such as rohu, pangasius, and silver barb.


                                                                                                  11

   In terms of quantity of feed used during the last production cycle, the average quantity of
total feed used by households in the small group was three times less than that by households
in the large group but was quite similar to that by households in the medium group (cf. Table
3). However, when we look at the quantity of total feed used per hectare of pond size, the
trend was quite similar to that of stocking density, with the households in the small group
having a much higher feed use intensity. The average feed use intensity by households in the
small group (5421.96 kg/ha) was more than three times higher than that by households in the
medium group (1934.45 kg/ha) and large group (1500.19 kg/ha). When comparing by the
type of feed, the high use intensity by households in the small group was also observed in the
use of rice bran and pellet feed. Comparing the type of feed used by different households (cf.
Table A1), the main types of feed were rice bran and pellet. Almost 93% of the survey
households reported using rice bran as feed, followed by pellet feed at 78% of the
households. The other types of feed, such as broken rice and cooked rice, were much less
common with less than 15% of the households using them. The most common sources of feed
were the feed mill and NGO at 75.5% and 73%, respectively.

   Lime, phosphate, and urea were the most commonly used fertilizers for the households to
promote fish growth (cf. Table A2). Lime is an important material to put into the empty
ponds at the pond preparation and repairing stage before stocking the fingerlings due to the
quantity of organic waste that accumulates at the bottom of the pond during the previous fish
production cycle. Removing this waste helps to disinfect the bottom of the pond from
harmful bacteria and to control the pH level of water, which in turn ensure sustainable fish
production. After that, phosphate is another important fertilizer after stocking the fingerlings
because phosphate stimulates the growth of phytoplankton and animals zooplankton, which
serve as the primary source of food to fish. Similar to the other inputs, a pattern was observed
that the average quantity of total fertilizer use in the last cycle was the highest among
households in the large group, but the opposite was true for fertilizer use per hectare. The
fertilizer use intensity of households in the small group (5371.94 kg/ha) was more than triple
that by households in the medium group (1550.30 kg/ha) and the large group (1350.67
kg/ha), respectively (cf. Table 4).

   Overall, the harvested quantity of all fish species in the last cycle was significantly higher
among households in the large group. The same pattern was observed in the most common
fish species: rohu, pangasius, and silver barb. When yield per hectare was compared across
the groups, the results were different. We reported earlier that the households in the

                                                                                               13

small group had a higher stocking density per hectare, as well as input use intensity per
hectare. It indicated that the owners of the smaller ponds in the sample used their ponds more
intensively compared to the other fish farmers with bigger ponds. Therefore, they also had a
higher yield per hectare of pond size. This higher yield among the households in the small
group was statistically significant (cf. Table 5). As mentioned above, one possible
explanation is due to a higher degree of intensification from additional feed and other inputs.
All the fish farmers in our sample are smallholders, including the farmers in the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù
group, so we do not observe the higher intensity of input use that is usually associated with
the big-scale aquaculture operators.




                       Figure 9. Percentage by weight of fish harvested

   In terms of the use of harvested output (cf. Table 7), the most common response by
farmers was that the harvest was sold (196.23 kg), and only a small amount was kept for
household consumption (16.54 kg). The households in the large group sold more of their
output, as they also harvested more. The quantity kept for own consumption, however, was
not significantly different statistically across the farmers with different pond size. Among
farmers who sold their output, 78% of them reported that they mainly sold the fish directly to
rural consumers (cf. Table 8). This was especially true for the households in the small and
medium groups. The large group also mainly sold the harvest directly to rural consumers, but
they used the other channels, such as traders and urban consumers, more than the households
with smaller ponds did. These differences were statistically significant.


                                                                                                16

                    Figure 11. Percentage by weight of harvested fish sold

   The fish types that were most common in terms of the weight of fish harvested were rohu
and pangasius (cf. Figure 9). From Figures 10 and 11, we see that rohu and pangasius were
also the main species in both consumption and sale, whereas the other species, such as
common carp and mrigal, were mainly farmed for household consumption. If we focus on the
fish types that were stocked (cf. Table 6) instead of the weight of fish harvested, we see that
about the same number of households (43%) stocked rohu and pangasius. There was no
significant difference in fish type across the three pond size groups, except that more farmers
with small ponds stocked mrigal than farmers with large ponds. This could be because the
farmers with small ponds were more likely to farm fish for own consumption.

   4.2. Gender analysis in aquaculture

During the household survey, farmers were asked about the different activities they
implemented during fish production in the last cycle and how many person-days of the
household member or hired labor worked in those activities. Most of the farmers reported that
the person-days of household member were considerably higher than those of hired labor (cf.
Tables A3 and A4). This was because the ponds of the households were small, so they could
be managed by the household members themselves, except during the labor intensive period
such as harvesting. The pattern of labor use during the last production cycle was very similar
to that of other inputs. As the households in the small group practiced the more intensive fish
farming system, they also had a higher labor use intensity per hectare.

   Comparing the gender of the labor involved in the various aquaculture activities, the male
household members were the ones who worked more person days on feeding, irrigation and
drainage, and harvesting, while female household members were more involved in pond
preparation and repair, fertilizer application, and weeding activities (cf. Figure 12). The
situation was less evenly distributed in the case of hired labor (cf. Figure 13), as almost all
the hired workers were male and hired male labor also had higher person days in all
activities. Overall, hired labor was not frequently used in small-scale fish farming, as most of
the survey households could manage their pond using only household labor.

                                                                                                  21

    Figure 13. Average person days of hired labor in the last aquaculture production cycle

   In addition to involvement in labor activities, households were also asked during the
survey to identify the main decision maker(s) in aquaculture, such as on decision related to
pond management and whether to consume or sell the harvest (cf. Table 9). Even though
there was a gender balance in labor activities of aquaculture among household members, the
decision related to input use and pond management was mainly made by males, as only 17%
of the households had at least a female among the decision makers of pond management. The
situation was more equal on the decision related to how to use the harvest, for example
whether the household wanted to keep the harvested fish for household consumption or to sell
it. In this instance, about 39% of the households had females among the decision makers. In
both cases of decision making, there was no significant difference when comparing
households with different pond size.

   Figure 14 presents the number of survey households in each pond size group that fall into
a unitary or non-unitary model of intra-household decision making. This refers to the same
two decisions in aquaculture mentioned above. The unitary model considers household
behavior as resulting from the decision of a single individual ignoring differences in intra-
household preferences (Samuelson, 1956). On the other hand, in a cooperative model, which
is a non-unitary model, a household consists of members who have their own utility function,
but the final decision of the household results from an interaction between members
(Chiappori, 1988). As shown in Figure 14, most of the survey households followed the


                                                                                                22

unitary decision making process. It indicates that these households are less likely to have
bargaining going on between the male and female household members in the decision related
to pond management and harvest use, as the decision was mainly made by one person. This
was the case in 75% and 87%, respectively, of the households in making decision on harvest
use and pond management. This pattern of unitary decision making seemed to be consistent
across the households with different pond sizes.

   4.3. Food security

Most of the households consumed different types of fish on average three times per week.
Own production was rarely the only source of fish for household consumption, partly due to
the seasonal nature of aquaculture, but also partly due to the variety offered by purchase from
market. Farmers also consumed fish caught from the wild and sold the harvested fish for cash
or for dietary variation. Fish caught from the wild was relatively accessible because the
villages are located near the river and wild fish sometimes entered the pond during flooding
in the monsoon season. As we can see from Figure 15, a majority of fish consumed was
purchased from the market, while the contribution from own production and wild catch were
about equal. This indicates that even among existing fish farmers, there is still a lot of room
to increase fish production to provide for household consumption.




   Figure 15. Percentage by weight of household fish consumption from different sources



                                                                                                  24

    As shown in Figure 10, rohu, pangasius, and silver barb were the main fish species from
own production that were consumed. Figures 16 and 17 show the main fish species consumed
that were caught from the wild and purchased from market, respectively. Snakehead, climbing
perch, and various types of catfish were the main species caught from the wild, while pangasius,
rohu, and snakehead were the main species bought from market. The total fish consumption
during the last 7 days was reported at 2.842 kg per household. Within this total, the average
consumption of tilapia was 0.089 kg per household. According to the list of species stocked by
the more than 400 survey households in the last cycle, tilapia was farmed by only two
households (one in the small pond group and the other in the large pond group). The quantity
of tilapia fish consumed, however, was about 5% both from the fish caught in the wild and
purchased from market (cf. Figures 16 and 17), indicating a potential for increasing the farming
of tilapia.

    Household dietary diversity score (HDDS) and women‚Äôs dietary diversity score (WDDS)
were constructed based on the guidelines by FAO (2013), with twelve food groups in HDDS
and nine food groups in WDDS. These helped to provide an indication of household economic
access to food and reflect the probability of micronutrient adequacy of the diet. A higher score
in HDDS indicated a higher diversity in household economic access to food, as more food
groups were consumed. A higher score in WDDS indicated a higher probability of
micronutrient adequacy of diet. The composition of food groups consumed by households over
the previous week was shown in Table 11. The HDDS of survey households was ten food
groups out of a total of twelve food groups and the WDDS was six food groups out of a total
of nine food groups. There was no significant difference statistically across the three groups of
farmers both in terms of HDDS and WDDS. In contrast, a statistically significant difference
was observed in HDDS and WDDS between households with male and female household heads.
HDDS and WDDS of the male-headed households were slightly higher than those of female-
headed households. Note that this was just an analysis of correlation between the two types of
households and did not indicate any causal relationships between gender of household head
and food diversity. The details of the proportion of households who consumed the various food
groups over the previous week are shown in Tables A5 and A6. Among the food groups, cereals,
vegetables, and oil were the most common food groups and were consumed by all survey
households. This is as expected because rice is the main staple food of the households in the
study area and is usually consumed at all meals. In addition, oil is one of the main ingredients



                                                                                              25

included when preparing dishes, and vegetables are grown by almost all households the whole
year round in the area surrounding their houses.

   4.4. Income and non-farm expenditure

Tables 13 displays the percentage of household income coming from different sources. Crop
production was the main source of income for the survey households with an average of
57.35% followed by part-time job not related to farming at 11.64%. Fish production was only
the fourth most important income source at 6.43%. This showed the growth potential for
aquaculture in the study area.




          Figure 18. Percentage of household income from different farming sectors




       Figure 19. Percentage of household income from different non-farming sectors




                                                                                         28

Comparing the importance of the different sources of income across the farmers with
different pond sizes, the share of income coming from fish production was significantly
greater in households that owned bigger ponds compared to those owning medium or small
ponds. In terms of crop production, households from the small pond group had a statistically
smaller share of income coming from this sector than those from the medium and large pond
groups. For these households from the small pond group, even though crop production was
their main source of income just like the farmers from the other groups, they also relied more
heavily on off-farm part-time job compared to the other farmers. Finally, differences in the
share of income from the livestock sector, off-farm businesses, and off-farm full-time job
were not statistically significant across households of different pond sizes.

   Table A7 shows the monthly expenditure by households. Food was the item in which
households allocated the highest budget (92,488 Kyat), in which 18.5% of the total food
expenditure was spent on fish. Transportation was the second highest item in monthly
expenses with an average of 23,071 Kyat spent per month followed by electricity and water at
16,217 Kyat and the purchasing of charcoal and kerosene at 15,657 Kyat. The monthly
expenditure trend was similar among households with different pond sizes, except that
transportation expenses were statistically higher in households from groups 2 and 3 compared
to those from group 1. Some expenditure items such as food and transportation were asked at
a monthly level because it was easier for the respondents to recall, but for other items that
were paid less frequently such as education and clothing, they were asked at an annual level.
The expenditure for these items are shown in Table 14. On average, the highest expenditure
per household for these items was on education at 538,964 Kyat per year, followed by house
maintenance and repairs at 317,216 Kyat and health at 254,563 Kyat. Regarding the
differences in mean, expenses on clothing were statistically higher in households belonging
to group 2 compared to those in groups 1 and 3. In addition, farmers from the small pond
group made significantly less community donations and paid less taxes than the farmers from
the large pond group. Finally, looking at the total expenditure per year by each household,
which was calculated by converting the monthly expenditure in Table A7 to annual
expenditure and then adding them to the annual expenditure in Table 14, the average
spending was 2,887,600 Kyat per year per household. The difference in this amount between
households of different pond size groups was not statistically significant.

   4.5.        Other socioeconomic characteristics

Housing characteristics such as the materials used for walls, roof, and floor capture the living
condition of a household. Likewise, access to electricity, safe drinking water, sanitation, and
clean fuel for cooking reflects a household‚Äôs capacity to meet the functional requirements of a
safe home. When viewed as a whole, the information on housing characteristics helps to
provide a measure of household socioeconomic status (Briones, 2017).




             Figure 20. Percentage of household with various outer wall material




                Figure 21. Percentage of household with various floor material



As shown in Table A8, the most common materials used by the survey households for the
dwelling's outer walls were palm leaves and similar at 34.5%, followed by bamboo at 29.3%
and wood at 26.4%. However, bamboo was the most common material used by the


                                                                                              32

households in the small pond group and the difference between this group and the other
groups (medium and large ponds) was statistically significant. Regarding the floor material,
90% of the households used wood and 9% used brick or concrete. When comparing between
farmers in the small pond group and those in the large pond group, a higher percentage of the
former had wood as the floor material, while a higher percentage of the latter had brick and
concrete as the floor and outer wall material.

   In terms of access to drinking water, there was a similar trend across the three households
groups without any statistically significant differences. The most common source was pool,
pond, or lake at 90.3%, indicating that the cleanliness of drinking water could be a concern in
the study area. The collection of rainwater was the second most common choice at 8.1%.
Only 0.23% of the households used purified bottled water. As fuel for cooking, almost all
households used firewood with no significant difference between the household groups. It
was similar in the case of toilet facility, as the majority (87.3%) used pit latrine with cover.
Pit latrine without cover and hanging toilet were used by 5.6% and 5.8% of households,
respectively. The two most common sources of lighting in the study area were battery
(61.6%) and solar panel (31.1%). Across the groups, there was a statistically significant
difference in the use of battery, with households from the small pond group using this
lighting source more than those in the other groups did. In contrast, the use of solar panel in
households from the medium and large pond groups was significantly higher statistically.

   Table 15 displays the area of land owned, rented in, rented out, and cultivated across the
households groups. On average, households owned 3.75 hectares of land and cultivated 3.57
hectares. The area of land rented in and rented out was quite small in comparison at less than
10% of the land cultivated. There was mostly no significant difference between the three
groups of households, except that the area rented out by farmers from the large pond group
was significantly higher than that by farmers from the small pond group. Assets are
commonly used as a proxy for wealth because farmers with higher incomes tend to invest in
different assets. Among the survey households, the most common assets owned were
generator or battery at 81% of households, television at 52%, and boat at 42%. Table A9
depicts asset ownership classified according to the pond size of the farmers. The trend of
asset ownership was similar across the groups, except that generator and boat ownership was
statistically higher among households in the large pond group compared with the other
households.

   In addition to income, expenditure, and asset, we also examine the characteristics of
households that could facilitate or hinder aquaculture activities, such as access to credit and
information, participation in fish farmer group, and risk preference. Table 16 shows the
relevant information about these household characteristics across different pond size groups.
From the sample, 68.4% of the households received credits or financial support in the last
year, a majority (85.8%) participated in fish farmer group, and 54.8% received information
on weather condition, which could influence the decision of households in the timing of
various fish farming activities, such as pond preparation, irrigation, and harvesting. On a
scale from 0 to 9, with 0 being fully avoiding risks and 9 being fully prepared to take risks
when applying a new aquaculture technology, the average risk preference of the households
was 5.07, indicating that the households were approximately risk neutral, but edging toward
willing to take risks in trying out new aquaculture technology. Comparing across the
households with various pond sizes, there was no statistically significant difference in access
to credit and information, participation in fish farmer group, or risk preference.




5. Summary and outlook
Households in the project were involved in both agriculture and aquaculture, with more than
half of their total income coming from crop production. Aquaculture constituted less than
10% of the total, indicating that there is still a lot of room for improvement in developing
aquaculture among the survey households. Analysis showed that even though the farmers
with larger ponds produced more in total harvest, the yield per hectare from those with
smaller ponds were actually higher. The large pond farmers also had less intensive per
hectare use of inputs, such as fingerling, feed, and fertilizer. The reason could be because all
of the survey farmers were smallholders, including those in the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù pond group, and
aquaculture was not the main source of income for them. Therefore, the behavior and practice
of these ‚Äúlarge‚Äù pond farmers could be different from those observed among the big-scale
fish farmers. Comparing the fish type stocked by households with different pond sizes, the
differences were statistically insignificant for most species. The only exception was that more
farmers with small ponds stocked mrigal, which was a species mainly farmed for own
consumption. This could be because farmers with smaller ponds were more likely to farm
fish for household consumption. In terms of labor involved in aquaculture activities, the
majority was household members, as they could manage the work themselves due to the

                                                                                                  35

relatively small pond size. There was a gender balance in most of these fish farming activities
performed by the household labor. However, most of the hired labor was male and male
household members still predominantly made decision on aquaculture, such as pond
management and harvest use. This was especially true for the case of decision on input use
and pond management, as only 17% of the households had at least one female involved in the
decision making.

   There was no statistically significant difference in food security across the pond size
groups, both in household dietary diversity score and women‚Äôs dietary diversity score. In
terms of fish consumed by the survey households, more than half was purchased from the
market with less than a quarter coming from own production, indicating the potential in
promoting fish production for own consumption to supplement the fish purchased from
market. In addition, even though only two survey households farmed tilapia (less than 0.5%
of the sample), about 5% of the fish consumed was tilapia, indicating further the potential of
tilapia farming among survey households. Looking at other socioeconomic indicators, the
main source of income for all groups of farmers was crop production. However, farmers from
the large and medium pond groups had a heavier reliance on income from crop and fish
production, compared with farmers from the small pond group who also relied on part-time
off-farm job. There was no statistically significant difference across households in the three
pond size groups in total non-farm expenditure, land owned, land cultivated, accessing credit
and information, participation in fish farmer group, and risk preference.

   The next step of the project is to provide training on best management practices and
distribute fingerlings to the 200 households in the treatment group. In order to determine
whether there was a balance in the random assignment of the survey households to the
treatment and control groups, we ran t-tests to compare the treatment and control households
in some key indicators (cf. Table 17). These included several measures related to fish
production, such as pond size, yield, and total income from fish sale. In addition, we checked
for food security, household head characteristics, and various aspects of socioeconomic
characteristics, such as household size, non-farm expenditure, agricultural land owned, access
to credit and weather information, participation in fish farmer group, risk preference, and a
wealth index generated from housing conditions and assets owned. The difference between
the households in the treatment and control groups was not statistically significant in all of
these indicators. We also reran the t-tests with clustering of standard errors at the village level
and the difference remained statistically insignificant for all indicators.
