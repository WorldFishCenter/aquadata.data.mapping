Executive summary
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded project “Aquaculture: increasing
income, diversifying diets, and empowering women in Bangladesh and Nigeria” is
working in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions in the northwest region of Bangladesh,
areas with high levels of poverty, malnutrition, and significant development potential
for aquaculture. With views of emerging opportunities for expanding markets for
sustainable aquaculture, the IDEA project plans to support aqua feed markets. This
study is undertaken for an in-depth assessment of the existing market system of fish
feeds and ingredients with focus on recent advancement of intensification of carp
aquaculture in the northwest region Bangladesh.

The study covered Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. Both quantitative and qualitative
methods were applied in the data collection process. Data was collected from 128 fish
farmers, 84 middlemen, and 5 fish feed companies through questionnaire survey.
Simultaneously, qualitative data were collected through 19 KIIs with the Department
of Fisheries (DoF) officials, FIAB, feed companies, middlemen and ingredients traders.
Additionally, four FGDs were conducted with fish farmers as well.

Demand and supply gap analysis shows that 22.4% farmers were not able to apply
required quantity of feed even though more feed was required. It was roughly 117 kg
per household. It is not very common for the farmers to have crises of specific type of
feed in the market as they demanded.

Some companies are not utilising their full capacity to produce fish feed. The situation
indicates over-capacity of fish feeds. Again, new companies are entering in the market.
It is assumed that new feed companies which are entering the market lack adequate
market information. As a result, some companies are also losing business and closing
completely or migrating to other businesses. Due to the existence of significant
numbers of feed companies in the market, price fluctuation is infrequent. The feed
companies expect support in forecasting demand which helps to make efficient
production and marketing plans that would minimize business risk.

Since the farming has been intensifying over the time, 27% farmers will be under the
intensification farming system in 2022/23, which is only a 1-2% increase. The
intensification will lead to more manufactured feed demand. The companies are
expecting government initiative to export fish and fish products which will inspire the
people to intensify fish farming system. Estimated fish production in fish ponds shall
be 2.394 million ton in 2023 while this was 1.9 million ton in 2018.

Analysis on factors that regulate consumer preference of buying fish feed shows that
among the ready feed users, 76% buy ready fish feed as they think the quality is the
best compared to semi-auto/homemade feed. Almost half of the ready feed users find
no significant difference amongst most of the available ready feeds in the market. It is
to be noted that, none was reported the cost of semi-auto/homemade feed is high.
Thirty six percent (9 out of 25 semi-auto/homemade feed users) prefer using this for
low cost.



                                                                                          6

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



In case of mode of payment, 61% farmers buy ready feed or raw materials in cash,
10% in credit and 29% partially in cash or credit. Quality is the important factor and
31% farmers buy the better one with cash. Availability of different branded feeds do
not affect the choice of feed. When the farmers buy feed in cash, the majority go in a
competitive way. Degrees of relationship with sellers does not play a significant role in
buying of feed even in credit.

Promotional benefits and embedded services do not significantly influence choosing
the feed because most of the farmers think the promotional and service benefits are
similar for all companies. It was assumed that low income farmers buy feed in credit
but the data shows the inverse situation. The higher income earning farmers would
rather buy feed in credit largely compared to the lower income earners. Or they may
have better access to get the feed in credit. Again, one-third of the farmers depend on
sellers’ recommendation for use of commercial feed (is also called ready feed).
Interestingly, more experienced fish farmers used ready feed compared to semi-
auto/homemade feed. Moreover, the experienced farmers are higher in number in
terms of users of better quality feed and they try to buy the feed in cash in most cases.

Increase of fish feed price was 0.25-1% annually. Due to high competition and over
supply, the companies normally avoid increasing the price of fish feed. According to
the manufacturers, there is no possibility for the feed price to change in the next 5
years. Little changes can be found, not more than 0.5%. The price, however, mainly
depends on the price of macro raw materials.

Average production cost of per kg floating grower feed for carp in Bangladesh was
BDT 38.90 in June 2020 while it was BDT 30.15 for sinking feed. The cost was BDT
44.50 and BDT 33.30 for floating and sinking feed of tilapia growers, respectively. Due
to major cost’s share (70%), macro type raw materials are the main drivers in changing
feed price. Power (electricity) fluctuation is another factor.

Market margin of middlemen for floating feed was higher than sinking feed. Moreover,
the floating feed of carp was slightly higher compared to tilapia. Promotion on buying
was a significant factor in earning the margin. Though promotion on feed buy was
significantly contributing, promotion on feed sales was very low. Sales in cash normally
keep cash flow in the business and it increases business sales. The traders who have
other businesses apart from fish farming business, earn more profit from their feed
business due to getting commissions for high ceiling and bought feed at TP price.

FCR of carp targeted farming was 2.14. Though this was higher than other targeted
fish, the farming was still profitable, the farmers sold comparatively bigger size fish
which was higher at market price. FCRs of Pangas and Tilapia targeted farming was
comparatively low. FCR of high valued fish is very comfortable for farming but the
consumers for these species are fixed and limited.

The other results of FCR show that medium priced feed showed better performance
in fish farming. Farming performance was not expectedly satisfactory for the farmers
who applied for high priced feed. The high stocking density shows better performance
in feeding. Performance of floating feed was also better compared to other
combinations.


                                                                                           7

Contamination (eutrophication/algal bloom) of ready feed is reasonably low,
particularly after manufacturing when the feed is packed well. Normally, the feed is
delivered to dealers immediately after manufacturing. The packaging is also most
sophisticated and possibilities of contamination (mycotoxin) is almost nil. However,
after a certain time, mycotoxin growth is possible. Contamination of micro type raw
materials like additives is almost nil due to high quality packaging. Contamination of
macro type ingredients or raw material is comparatively high compared to other types.
Loading-unloading and transportation systems are the media of contamination of
macro type ingredients. Fortunately, the situation is improving now a days. Local
shops poorly manage the ingredients, especially during transportation and short-term
storing.

Credit transactions are not allowed by some large feed manufacturers and majority
sold their feed fully or partially in credit. Some feed companies appointed their dealers
who are generally large-scale fish farmers and sold feed in credit.

The money is paid through the swift money transfer system of the banks (pay order).
Both public and private banks are used for the money transactions. The traders do not
use any mobile financing (BKash, Rocket, Nagad etc.) due to high transfer fees.

Through the dealers buy the feed in cash, they mostly sell them in credit to the farmers.
Duration of pay for buying feed in credit depends on different situations like trust, fish
production cycle, relationship, kingship etc. In case of production cycle, farmers pay
after fish sales occur. Some farmers pay fully or partially during their next purchase.

The dealers buy feed in both cash and credit, but mostly sell in credit. The process
creates a transaction gap between cash inflow and outflow. The traders partially adjust
the gap using their own capital. Generally, a group of farmers pay their dues every
day. The paid amount is used to adjust the gap. The traders also borrowed money
from other traders, relatives, and neighbours for a very short period of time.

The companies also face a similar cash flow gap. They ask ingredient traders to sell
in credit for short terms. They also manage money from cash credit (CC) loans.
Traders get an average of 13 days for partial credit repayment, while their farmer-
buyers take 89 days. The 76 days partial credit gap is filled up through money obtained
from other businesses. In case of full credit, there is 90 days gap between supplier
and buyer credit repayment.

Churn rate indicates the percentage of clients that walk away from the business and
growth rate indicates opposite. Like many other sectors due to COVID-19, the fish
feed market may also have lost its normal growth. In the market, most of the cases
(90.6%) traders have to buy products in cash either advance or cash on delivery. In
contrast, half the transaction value is in credit with their clients.

Due to the introduction of new technology which provide quicker returns, some
individuals are now showing their interest in the fish farming. Some banks have also
started to take advantage of the opportunity. Both small and big feed mills borrowed
money from the bank. Some zones are very prominent for fish farming in the northern
region of the country and the financial institutions prefer the zones to disburse loans.


                                                                                           8

Some banks (like the RKUB) have special packages to provide loans for fish farming
but in limited amounts. Leased pond, transparency in valuation of land under pond etc.
are still concerns. This access is limited for the marginal fish farmers in case of formal
banks (public and private) but access to NGOs is better.

Most farmers do not maintain any records of fish farming practices. Some big farmers
use online channels like YouTube to get updated fish farming information and
technologies. But all feed and input traders maintain structured binding books which
are available in the market. None of the fish farmers and traders do use any special
type app or software. However, the fish feed mills use computers to maintain their
records.

Limited testing facilities are available in some government and autonomous
organizations including some universities in northern Bangladesh. Testing facilities are
available only at the divisional level, but none are available at Upazila and District
levels. DoF has realised that at least one lab is necessary at district level to monitor
feed quality in time.

Fish feed manufacturers are hugely dependable on import of major fish feed
ingredients. Locally produced maize is also used as feed ingredients. The
manufacturers sell 95% of their produced fish feed through their enlisted dealers or
agents. In addition, some large-scale farmers also buy the feed directly from
manufacturers. Dealers also sell the feed (around 95%) to farmers directly. Some
retailers/sub-dealers are also found in the chain who buy and sell fish feed in a limited
volume (5%). Small-scale farmers mainly buy fish feed from the retailers/sub-dealers.
Both formal and informal financial institutions support stakeholders of the fish feed
value chain on a limited scale.

This study recommends that medium-priced feed shows the best performance of fish
farming (FCR) and farmers can be suggested accordingly. By providing training for
local ingredients sellers would help to reduce the contamination. Since a significant
proportion of farmers used semi-auto feed, this would be sound to train them on
preparing good quality feed to make them more efficient. Moreover, authority needs
to care and tackle the group of people who manufactured poor quality feeds. It is also
recommended that the financial institutions need to refresh the current pattern of loan
disbursement system and awareness building on loan disbursement rules is
necessary for the fish farmers to increase their access to the loan. Finally, the
availability of testing facilities (at least at the district level) would speed up process of
feed quality monitoring.

Background
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded project “Aquaculture: increasing income,
diversifying diets, and empowering women in Bangladesh and Nigeria” targets
Bangladesh and Nigeria, two countries where the growth of aquaculture provides
significant opportunities to enhance pond productivity, the income of smallholder
families, the diets and nutrition of vulnerable households and particularly women,
children and the empowerment of women.

The project is working in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions in the northwest region of
Bangladesh. These are areas with high levels of poverty, malnutrition, and significant
development potential for aquaculture. Within the target divisions, WorldFish will
strengthen partnerships with private sector businesses, investors and government to
develop profitable value chains and transform local government policies to enable
increased production and incorporate fish into nutritional improvement initiatives.

This is a 50-months long project which started from November 2018 and is scheduled
to end in December 2022 and builds on the emerging opportunities for expanding
markets for sustainable aquaculture.

Aquaculture contributes 56.24% in total fish production in Bangladesh (FRSS 2018).
Aquaculture production has been growing at a rate, on average, of yearly 1.42 % over
the last decade (391,753 MT in 2017/18 from 350,595 MT in 2009/10). Aquaculture
farming intensification is the key to such growth. The intensification comes mainly from
more use of inputs and a major share of the inputs led by aqua feed. The proportion
of highly intensive farming is comparatively low in the northwest region (1.15%)
compared to national intensity (4.38%) (FRSS 2010-2019). From this viewpoint,
production of aqua feed has been expanding and diversifying. But there are several
concerns around the feed, such as marketing efficiency, the balance between demand
and supply, variance in price and quality amongst feeds, equal access to the feeds for
marginal farmers, complexity and transparency in financial transaction and access to
finance, and the degree of contamination of feed and ingredients. The concerns are
dominant particularly in the northwest part of Bangladesh due to poverty, but there is
high potential for aquaculture.

As per statistics of 2019/20, there are around 1,00 aqua feed manufacturers in
Bangladesh and most of them produce both aqua and poultry feed. Estimated aqua
feed production in Bangladesh was 1.7 million MT in 2019, which is 0.27 million MT
higher compared to 1.43 million MT in 2015 (USEC, 2016). Of the quantity, 0.12-0.13
million MT is estimated to be supplied to Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. This is now
somehow assumed whether the supply has exceeded the existing demand in
Bangladesh. In addition, there are more than 1,000 farm-made pellet feed mills in
Bangladesh (Rashid, MM et al 2013).

By classification, floating feed is 60% of total aqua feed production and the rest is
sinking feed. Due to higher demand and less wastage in the water, the demand for
the floating fish feed has been increasing day by day though the price is comparatively
higher. When the feeds are classified as growth stages of fish, 5% are nursery feed,
15% are micro and pre-starter, 45% grower and the rests (35%) are finishers. By
species, 12-14% feeds are used for high valued catfish (Shing, Magur, Koi, Pabda and

                                                                                          10

Gulsha), 38-40% for Tilapia, 21-23% for Pangas, 17-19% for Carp and 3-4% for prawn
and shrimp.

Bangladesh’s feed industry mostly depends on import for major feed ingredients.
Soybean (full fat), Soybean (De oil), fish meal, dry fish, rapeseed oil cake, maize,
wheat, De oil rice bran, poultry meal, protein concentrate, corn protein meal, DDGS
(dried distiller grains), blood meal, fish oil, limestone, synthetic binder, Di calcium
phosphate, Mono-calcium phosphate, vitamins, minerals, and some additives like
enzyme probiotics, Choline chloride etc., are the main imported ingredients. According
to USDA (2017). Soybean was the top of listed imported items in Bangladesh followed
by maize in 2016/17 1 . The ingredients are also used to produce poultry feed in
Bangladesh except for fish oil, wheat flour, wheat, synthetic binder and dry fish.

The farmers also use supplementary diets which are around 2% of the total feed used
in the fish ponds. The supplementary diets comprise a mixture of locally available
ingredients such as rice bran, wheat bran and mustard oilcake. Supplementary feeds
are used in the extensive carp polyculture farms and occasionally in extensive tilapia
farms. Farm’s by-products are the key feed ingredients with the farmers mixing the
feed ingredients manually. In general, farmers use a mixture of 50% rice bran, 20%
wheat bran and 30% oilcake (FAO 2015). Some farmers also use wheat flour
occasionally in their farms. It is estimated that 12% of farmers use only supplementary
diets and 45% of farmers use supplementary diets along with the ready feed. Most
users of supplementary feeds are marginal farmers. However, due to higher levels of
poverty, the numbers of supplementary diets (home-made feed) users are also higher
in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions.

Under the above circumstance and the emerging opportunities for expanding markets
for sustainable aquaculture, the IDEA project plans to support aqua feed markets. With
this view, the study has been undertaken.

2. Methodology
The study covered Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. The areas, types of data and
information that were collected are briefly discussed below according to the scope of
works.

General overview on all types of fish feeds used in the northwest region Bangladesh:
To acquire a general overview of fish feeds in northwest region of Bangladesh, related
works of literatures include fisheries statistics, published pieces of literature of FAO,
WorldFish, journal articles and other value chain studies from website (e.g.,
researchgate, BDFish, marketsandmarkets.com) were reviewed.

Demand and supply gap of carp fish feed: present and succeeding 5 years: The data
relating to the demand, supply, the cause of gap, gap in next five years, factors
influencing the gap and how they influence it, when the gap will meet or not, if meet
what will be business dimension of feed companies etc., were collected from fish
farmers, feed companies and ingredient traders.

The study suggested convenient model for forecasting fish feed demand. The points
such as forecasting of feed production and demand for next five years, what factors
may influence this forecasting and how they influence, were also discussed.

Factors that influence the price of feed (includes separate sections for production
profitability and market margin): In this part, data in connection with factors that control
feed price and how (macro & micro), change in price (analysis from last five years)
and forecasting for next five years (for grower feed: carp and tilapia), which factors
may influence this forecasting and how it exerts influence, were collected from fish
feed companies.

Factors that affect the profitability of feed mill (ingredient price fluctuation, fuel price,
credit etc.), value distribution from feed mill to farmers, factors influencing the
profitability of dealers were illustrated by collecting data from feed mills and respective
dealer/sub-dealers. A comparative performance analysis focusing on FCR considering
different feed (sinking, floating) usage, feed price, water treatment and stocking (size
& number) was completed.

In-depth assessment of the existing market system of carp feeds and ingredients: In
feed value chain analysis, the chain, product flow and actor description (ingredient
supply to feed mill to the dealer to the farmer), service sector contribution and valuation,
the relationship among value chain actors (vertical and horizontal) were included. Data
regarding marketing competency (large-medium-small feed mill & dealer), marketing
strategy of feed company and dealers, market promotion tools, market
performance assessment (market share), product performance assessment (sinking,
floating etc., and by species) were collected from dealer/sub-dealer. Data was also
collected from ingredient traders to understand marketing channel detail and market
constraints of major ingredients (fish meal, rice bran, soybean meal, feed additive).

Factors that regulate consumer preference: In this part, how farmers chose feed was
analyzed. The data included a variety of choices according to buying capacity/credit,

                                                                                           12

experience sharing from other farmer, dealer’s advice, branding, technical support
from feed company, commission/ profit margin, credit facilities, etc. to understand the
factors. In this respect, data was gathered from farmers..

Assessment of the possible reasons/sources of contamination in fish feed and
ingredients: Possible nodal point of contamination in the feed supply chain: the timing,
causes, and percentage of adulteration were inspected. Data related to this were
collected from ingredient traders, feed companies and dealers/sub-dealers who deal
with ingredients and feed.

Financial transaction, documentation/digitization, and credit system among feed value
chain actors and possible ways of ensuring small farm-holders to access credits to
access feed for intensifying their production: Under this scope of work, data related to
adopted financial and credit systems among value chain actors were collected from
concerned financial institutions. This included percentages of cash and credit
transaction among value chain actors (ingredient suppliers and feed additive suppliers
who supply to feed mill, feed mill to dealer, and dealer to farmer), duration of credit,
any extra payment (or addition in price) for credit sales (difference in credit and cash
sell), comparison with bank’s interest rate If amount and duration of credit turns to
interest rate and also other terms/condition, flexibility, mode of payment, installment,
availability of institutional loan/credit facilities (including micro credit) in project areas,
types, types of bank loan and L/C for feed value chain actors (ingredient/ feed additive
suppliers, feed mill , dealer, farmers) etc.

The points such as financial transaction system in different level for different actors
(mobile financial system/ bank transfer/ TT/cheque etc.), loan for a small and marginal
farmer for buying feed (bank or micro-credit or development organization, banks, etc.),
insurance facilities in this sector etc., were included in the data collection. The data
was collected from ingredients traders, feed company, dealers/sub-dealers and local
financial institutions.

Constraint and opportunity analysis of imported and local feed ingredients: Utilising
the collected information, SWOT and PESTLE analysis were done.

The study included three data collection methods: questionnaire interview, FGD and
KII. The sampling mechanism is briefly described in Table 1.

A questionnaire interview was conducted with 128 fish farmers to collect data
regarding basic profile, pond description, feed use, demand, factors regulating
consumer preference, financial transactions, and access to credit. The sample size
was estimated following arbitrary technique 2 assuming data will be normally
distributed (statistically, a sample size of 30 is assumed normally distributed). The
convenience sampling technique was applied to collect data from one sample farmer
to another. The questionnaire prepared for farmers is presented in Annex 1.

Questionnaire interviews were also conducted to collect data from 84 middlemen (51
dealers, 14 sub-dealers, 19 retailers) and 5 feed companies (altogether 89). The
sample size was drawn by applying an arbitrary approach. The data from the
middlemen and feed companies was used to analyze market margin (questionnaire is
presented in Annex 3) and production profitability (questionnaire is presented in Annex
2) respectively.

Both national and local level commercial feed companies are sources of fish feed
supply in the northwest region. Data from national feed companies were collated to
calculate feed supply. Amount of fish feed supplied by local feed companies were
calculated based on the samples. Following this, the amount was extrapolated to
obtain the total supply. Finally feed amounts of national and local feed companies
were aggregated.

Under the qualitative part, four FGDs (one each division) were conducted to satisfy
assessment of the existing market system of carp feeds; financial transaction;
digitalization; access to credit; and constraints. Fish farmers comprising small, medium
and large holdings in addition to different categories who followed traditional and/or
semi-intensive farming systems were the participants in the FGD. The FGD checklist
is presented in Annex 9.

In order to encapsulate the overall scenarios of fish feed industry, 19 KIIs (DOF
officials 4, FIAB-1, commercial feed companies-2, semi-auto feed mill-2, Middlemen-
8 (Dealer-4, Sub-dealer/retailer-4), feed ingredients importers/sellers-2) were
conducted. Checklists for all of the KIIs are presented in Annex 4 to 8.

3. Data quality
Quality control in whole data collection process was very important to represent a real-
world situation. In this process, five data quality assessment (DQA) points (validity,
integrity, reliability, precision and timeliness) were considered. Before the start of data
collection, a team of five qualified data enumerators were appointed. A three days long
training (Figure 1) including a day-long field practice was conducted for ensuring clear
and common understanding on the questionnaire and method of data collection. A

  This method is used when there isn’t a full population list available. People are not selected randomly, therefore the size and effect of
sampling error (missed persons, unequal representation, etc.) is unknown. This sampling type is effective when it is tried to generate ideas
and get feedback, but it does not generalize results to an entire population with a high level of confidence. Non-probability is convenient and
less costly and limited to time and others. In this study, in fact, we are not calculating actual estimate of profitability or others. Some
qualitative perceptions will be generated.



                                                                                                                                           14

guideline regarding data collection management and clear understanding of the
questions was also developed. A robust android based data collection template with
proper skip logic, validation rule was developed. This system minimized data entry
and transcription error. The system also facilitated a fast check of collected data and
options for instant/daily feedbacks.

4. Results and discussions
5.1 Demand and supply gap
Almost one forth (22.4%) farmers could not or did not apply feed though more feed
was required in their ponds. According to household survey, estimated additional feed
demand was 0.21 kg per decimal thus 117 kg per household. Actually, they could not
buy feed due to lack of money.

It is not very common for farmers to experience market crises of the particular feed
type they demand. Prepared feeds are available on the market sufficiently. Among the
respondents, only 1 farmer (out of 125) reported not finding specific targeted types of
fish (CP feed) on the market and purchasing a different feed for satisfying demand.

In Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions 46 commercial feed manufacturers are active. Most
of the feed companies are not using the full capacity to produce fish feed (some like
ACI Godrej, Bangla Feed etc., are functioning at only 50% of their total capacity). The
situation indicates an oversupply of fish feed in the market. The fish farmers are
intensifying the farming system over the period and increasing manufactured feed’s
usage; the new feed companies are also entering the market. It is assumed new feed
companies entering the market lack adequate market information. As a result, some

                                                                                              15

                            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



companies are incurring losses, closing down or migrating to other businesses. Due
to the existence of significant numbers of feed companies in the market, price
fluctuation is infrequent. Prices are changed once or twice a year by most companies.
In some cases, some companies also decrease feed prices to keep them stable or
increase their sales. Due to high competition and oversupply, changing or increasing
prices strategically becomes very difficult.

Since the fish industry is a very fast growing industry in Bangladesh, with new
companies entering the market every year. Fish feed business is also a part of
subsidised agricultural sector of Bangladesh government. This facility mainly attracts
people to enter into this market. The entrance of such unplanned numbers of
companies may create an oversupply. According to feed companies, the government
needs to calculate the total capacity of demand and supply, and apply rules and policy
to ensure balance. The government should be strict in approving registration for selling
fish feed in the market.

When supply and demand will be balanced, the market will exist in a perfectly
competitive situation. This will demand a situation of price stability. The perfect
competition will also ensure quality feed as the companies will produce quality feed to
settle down in the competitive market.

Since the farming has been intensifying over time, 27% of fish farming (28,415 ha) are
projected to be under intensification farming system in 2022/23 (estimated with linear
trend analysis), this is currently 25-26% (27,155 ha) in 2017/18 (FRSS 2018). This is
estimated 29,143 ha to be in 2024/25 (Figure 2). The intensification will lead to more
manufactured feed demand. Newer companies will enter the market but the
companies who are inefficient will automatically be forced from the market. Only the
companies which strictly maintain the quality and can keep themselves updated, will
survive in the market. It is also necessary to cope with changing situation (more
sophisticated technology, new species etc.) and compromise the existing structure to
survive. The company should adopt or adapt the new technology and new fish farming
dimensions and changes to survive in the market.

Figure 2: Fish farming intensification trend

This forecasting is done based on the government’s statistical data and data from feed
companies. The companies are also expecting government initiative to export fish and
fish products which will inspire the people to intensify the fish farming system. The
global economy and government policy may highly affect the forecasting. Advanced

                                                                                                           16

                Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



research also helps to introduce new farming technologies and new species. The
funding on fisheries research is another factor that would affect the forecasting.
Developing feed demand forecasting model: Population, fish price, per capita
income (income elasticity) and fish consumption trend are the main factors affecting
volume of national fish production. Based on the data of nine years from 2010 to 2018,
the following model is estimated which helps to forecast the fish production. Again, the
fish production is directly associated with fish feed demand. When production rises,
farmers will be more interested to buy more fish feed (Annex 10). Estimated fish
production shall be 2.394 million ton in 2023 while it was 1.9 million ton in 2018. If the
factors follow the same trend, additional fish production will result in additional demand
for fish feed. This is basically happened due to increased population and increased
fish consumption. Fish price is also another factor, but not significant.

Fish production = - 5,884,697 + 44 (Population) + 11,423 (Fish consumption) + 0.692
(Income) + 1,369 (Fish price).

The other forecasting models are also presented below which would give an idea
about the advantages and limitations of different models. Based on data limitations
any of the following models can also be used.

Straight line model: The straight-line method is one of the simplest and easy-to-follow
forecasting methods. Assuming a constraint growth rate calculated from last two years’
available data, forecast values are estimated for following years. One example is
shown in Table 2, based on available fish production data for 2017 and 2017, growth
rate (0.0366) is calculated. It is assumed that the growth rate is constant for the next
few years and fish production is estimated to be 2.27 million ton in 2023.

Moving average model: Moving averages are a smoothing technique that looks at the
underlying pattern of a set of data to establish an estimate of future values. The most
common types are the 3-times and 5-times moving averages. While data from 2010
to 2018 are fitted in the model, it estimated fish production to be 1.77 million ton in
2019. Fish production can similarly be estimated for subsequent years.

Simple Liner Regression Model: Using the simple linear model, the following
forecasting is estimated (Figure 3).

Simple linear regression model: Fish production = 1,000,000 + 96684 (time)

As per forecasting model, fish production in 2023 will be 2.35 million ton in Bangladesh.

Ways of data extraction and limitations of modelling: Data for all past years were not
available and some data was filled with trend analysis. Price data was unavailable in
the government’s publications. The data for 6 years were extracted from the WorldFish
implemented project USAID AIN (2012-17) and this is derived from southern
Bangladesh. Income data were calculated from GDP and population data; the same
method was also used by other authors (Cai, J. & Leung, P.S. 2017).

5.2 Market system of fish feed and ingredients
5.2.1 Factors that regulates consumer preference of buying fish feed

Farmers generally buy ready feed (called manufactured/commercial feed) or raw
materials for processing semi-auto/homemade fish feed and use it in the ponds. The
farmers take decisions on which types of feed they will use depending on different
factors. It was assumed that the associated factors would be feed quality, price,
availability, relationship, promotional benefits, embedded services, payment method,
distance, family income, farming experience, locality, the influence of other farmers,
sellers’ recommendations, frequency of feed use, level of knowledge about feed etc.
Again, whether the farmers are buying feed in cash or credit may also associated with
some of the factors.

Data show that 80% of farmers mainly use ready fish feed and the rest use semi-
auto/homemade feed. Among the ready feed users, 76% (76 out of 100) buy ready
fish feed as they are of the opinion that the quality is better than that of the semi-
auto/homemade feed although the farmers who use semi-auto/homemade feed (76%;
19 out of 25) do not find any difference in quality.

Data revealed that ready feed users are mostly quality sensitive clients. They do not
think price is a determining factor for their choice. Half of the farmers (47%) reported
that their chosen brand’s price is similar to the other competitive brand. Rather, they
placed a premium on quality when selecting a brand, with 76% of ready feed users


                                                                                                                     18

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



rating the quality of their used feed brand as superior to that of other available brands
on the market. 29% of ready feed users believe they are paying more for higher quality
feed.

In contrast, semi-auto feed users seem price sensitive clients, 76% of farmers reported
their feed quality is similar to other available products and 64% think price is also
similar to other competitive semi-auto feed. It is to be noted that, none reported the
cost of semi-auto/homemade feed to be high. Thirty six percent (9 out of 25 semi-
auto/homemade feed users) are rather using this for lowered costs.

In case of the mode of payment, 61% farmers buy ready feed or raw materials in cash,
10% in credit and 29% partially in cash or credit. Quality is an important factor and
31% of farmers buy the better one with cash. Though around 30% (37 out of 76)
farmers also buy in cash but they don’t think their feed is as good as expected; this is
similar to other branded feeds. Again, one-third of farmers (33%; 41 out of 125) buy in
credit fully or partially and they have no objection about quality. It is clear from the
analysis that the mode of payment does not have influence on choosing feed brands.

Farmers emphasized availability when choosing any brand. 42% of the ready feed
users reported their chosen brand was more available compared to its competitive
one. Besides, 51% reported their chosen brand to be similarly available to its
competitors. Similarly, 72% of semi-auto feed users reported their product (raw
materials) was available when compared to their competitors and 28% think their
material’s availability to be higher than its competitors.

When the farmers buy feed in cash, the majority go in a competitive way (with a similar
relationship with 46 farmers out of 76). Whether the relationship between farmers and
sellers is stronger or as usual, it is really not a significant factor to determine payment
modality during buying feed (Table 2).

Promotional benefits and embedded service (like commission if target is overachieved
on target sales, discount offers, carrying transport cost by company, tour in home and
abroad, specific amount is free on target amount, gift items etc) do not significantly
influence choosing the feed in terms of buying ready or semi-auto/homemade feed,
even what would be the mode of payment. This is because most of the farmers think
that the promotional and service benefits are same for all companies.

Farmers’ preference is determined by the distance of the seller point from their
household. Farmers emphasize on distance when selecting a brand, availability of the
feed in their neighborhood. Data revealed 61% ready feed users reported that they
bought the ready feed because it was available in their locality compared to another
brand. A similar trend was also observed for semi-auto feed users (56%).

There is no significant difference between higher or lower income whether the farmers
buy semi-auto or homemade feed. Average monthly income for both ready feed users
and semi-auto/homemade feed users are mostly the same. But income was slightly
higher for those who used better quality feed (as per farmers’ opinion). It was assumed
that low income farmers buy feed in credit but the data shows the inverse situation.
The higher income earning farmers would rather buy feed in credit, compared to the
lower income farmers. Or they may have better access to get the feed in credit.

                                                                                           19

 understand
 importance of
 different types of
 feed

One-third farmers (39%) depend on sellers’ recommendation for use of commercial
feed, even 55% of farmers rely on the seller’s recommendations to know the quality of
feed. The farmers have no influence seeing other farmers on what types of feed they
will use. Even, no significant influence was found from opinion leaders for choosing
feed.

There is some significance of farming experience in choosing feeds. More experienced
fish farmers used ready feed compared to semi-auto/homemade feed. Moreover, the
experienced farmers are higher in number in terms of users of better-quality feed and
they try to buy the feed in cash in most cases.

Different types of feeds are available in the market like nursery, starter, grower, finisher
etc. The farmers were asked about the understanding of the different types of feeds
available in the market. Farmers who reported that their level of understanding about
the feed types is better, they usually used commercial feed. Most of them even bought
feed in cash fully or partially.

Moreover, cash in hand is the main driver for farmers whether they will buy fish feed
in credit or not. When the farmers have enough cash money in hand, they look for
better quality feed. When they have no sufficient money in hand, they look for better
quality within purchasing capability. According to sellers, they sell ready feed or
ingredients at slightly higher price (almost BDT 1.0 per kg) when sell in credit.

5.2.2 Trend of ready fish feed price

The increase of fish feed price was 0.25-1% annually although the feed price of some
companies have been going down for some years. While it is difficult to adjust market
price due to the increase of ingredient price, some companies compromise the quality
or reorganize feed formulations. Due to high competition and oversupply, the
companies normally avoid increasing price. According to the manufacturers, there are
no possibilities to change the feed price in the next 5 years. They also added that little
changes can be found, but not more than 0.5%. However, the price of macro raw
materials is the key driver for changing the price.



                                                                                                        21

Factors influence in forecasting:

        Government regulations on the fish feed market, such as strengthening
         monitoring for feed quality, increasing testing facilities, reforming ingredient
         import policy, increasing fish export may affect the price.
        The fish feed industry heavily depends on imported ingredients. Additives are
         also essential ingredients for the fish feed and they are fully imported items.
         The trend of price of the ingredients in the global market particularly macro
         ingredients (maize, soya bean, fish meal, poultry meal, rapeseed oil cake etc.)
         will affect the price.
        Introducing new technology will create more feed demand or decrease the
         existing demand. This would not be significant the next five years but
         introducing new species (like pangas) would add extra demand of feed in the
         market and change the entire scenario in the fish market affecting the feed price
         ultimately.
Economic analysis: production and marketing of fish feed: The cost of feed production
varies on the basis of quality, particularly on protein percentage. A higher protein
percentage leads to a higher price. The average production cost per kg floating grower
feed for carp in Bangladesh was BDT 38.90 in June 2020 while this was BDT 30.15
for sinking feed. The cost was BDT 44.50 and BDT 33.30 for floating and sinking feed
of tilapia growers, respectively. The major cost incurred for macro type raw materials
like maize, rice polish, soya bean meal, de oiled rice bran (DORB), rapeseed oil cake,
fish meal/dry fish etc., this was around 70% of total cost. Additives (growth promoters,
vitamin, oil etc.) contributed only 5.5% of total cost, although this are very important
raw materials for any fish feed quality. The manufacturers also spent a sufficient
amount (8%) for promotional activities (Table 4).

Factors influencing profit of feed: The profit hugely depends on imported macro
ingredient price as this is sharing 70% of total production cost. Energy cost was
another significant head of the production cost which finally reduces profit. The energy
cost includes electricity, fuel and gas. The fuel price fluctuation depends on the global
market which affects the feed cost ultimately leading to the higher price.

Transportation cost was also another important factor for profit which basically link
with fuel price and unrest situation of the country. Under-usage of total capacity of
production is affecting the profit of the feed business. The usage of full operational
capacity will decrease operational and management cost, which may help to increase
profits. Bank interest rate for loans does not significantly influence the feed production
cost because normally the banks do not change the rate frequently due to high
competition in the market. Recently the bank interest rate decreased and profit
increased a little bit but this does not help significantly.

Market margin of middlemen: Among the different types of ready feeds (nurserer,
starter, grower and finisher), grower feed was sold in a large volume. Among farmed
fish, carp and tilapia were the main species in the northern part, even in Bangladesh.
Again, price also varied between floating and sinking type feed. The floating feed has
been getting more popular in the fish farming in the last five year. With this point, the
market margin of ready feed of carp and tilapia grower by floating and sinking feed
are calculated separately. Many national (Quality, Fresh, CP, Megha, Tongway,
Aftab etc.) and local feed companies (Bangla, Satata etc.) are marketing the ready
feed in northern Bangladesh. The calculation is an average of ready feeds of
different companies to understand the profit of middlemen, particularly the dealer
and sub-dealer of the ready feed.

Analysis shows that the market margin of floating feed was higher than that for sinking
feed. Moreover, the margin of carp floating feed was slightly higher compared to tilapia.
Promotion on buy was a significant factor in changing profit (e.g., 0.56 out of 2.85 for
carp floating, this was 20%). Though promotion on feed buy was significantly
contributing, promotion on feed sales was noted to be very low (BDT 0.04 and 0.23
for per kg feed sales) (Table 5). Interestingly, the marketing cost (advertise, poster,
local cable TV etc.) of ready feeds by the middlemen were almost nil.

Factors influence dealer’s profit: Transportation cost is the factor that influences
profit of fish feed of the dealers. Transport costs vary unexpectedly any time
particularly during the country’s unrest. Long delays due to roads and traffic, interrupt
the delivery in time and it increases transport costs.

Business loss occurred for the fish farmers who bought feed in credit. Since most of
the dealers sell feed in credit, payment particularly for the farmers who made losses
in fish farming are delayed. It introduced trouble regarding cash liquidity that hampers
the profit. The traders reported credit recovery roughly 98-99%.

Sales vary across the year and it decreases down during winter which reduces their
business profit due to less commission from the feed manufacturers; however, some
fixed costs like room rent, electricity cost remain the same.

Crisis in or short supply of feed by manufacturers reduces the cash flow and it affects
business profit in some cases.

Frequent promotion or commission on feed normally increase feed sales that also
subsequently increase their business profit.

Sales in cash normally keep cash flow in the business and it increases business sales.
It is basically not possible since they operate business in their locality and most of the
people are known to them, such as neighbours and relatives. It was one kind of
obligation to sell product in credit due to their acquaintance. Some traders, however,
believes on sales on credit makes more sales and earn more profit.

Some traders run other businesses along with feed business. So, they have to spend
some time for the other business. Sharing time among different businesses also
affects fish business in getting higher profit.
The traders who have own fish farming business, earn more profit from feed business.
Buying feed more feed provides a trader with high ceiling of commission from the feed
companies. While the traders are buying more feed for their own fish farms, they are
getting higher rates of commission which gives them a higher profit in the business.
Normally the farmers buy feed at retail prices. But these traders buy feed at wholesale
price and use the feed for their own fish farms which also adds extra benefits.

Profit is higher from a better quality feed. Throughout the year a continuous demand
of quality fish feed is found among the farmers. Since the price of the quality feed is
high, a large volume at a time is not sold but regular sales round the year makes a
very good volume of sales which adds a good profit for the business. It is also
important that the quality feed is sold in cash for most cases and it increases the
money flow of the business which contributes as another factor of increasing the profit.

Very few traders realized the good relationship that supports their business to increase
transaction and profit. Some traders arranged an annual customer gathering event
(called Halkhata in Bengali). Most traders allow next sale in credit when the customers
repay earlier credit fully or partially.

Brand promotion by feed manufactures increased their sales and profit. The big
companies aired their brands through national media including both public and private
televisions, national daily and periodical newspapers. Fish feed of the companies are
already popular and gives them a regular secured profit. Sometimes, when or if they
face an image crisis in the market, the situation makes drastic fall of their product
market including fish feed and the dealers lose their profit.

Dealers’ incentives packages may be the factor affecting profits. This includes
commission on sales varying from 2-4%; for example, 4% commission on annual sales
on at least 400 ton (KII with feed dealers at Bogra 2020)

5.3 Feed use efficiency
Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was used to measure the efficiency of feed-usage. It is
difficult to calculate the FCR for individual species as most of the farmers follow
polyculture system. Considering the existing fish farming management pattern, system
level FCR is calculated.

Farmers use multiple combinations of fish feeds depending on the species of fish, feed
price, stocking density, stocking size, and types of feed (floating/sinking), etc. In
respect to the combinations, FCRs have been critically analysed and discussed.

Carp fattening (rui, catla and mrigel) is a dominating culture system in Rajshahi and
Natore districts. The majority of the farmers stocked larger sizes of carp fish and sold
certain portions (around 10-15%) after 3-4 months. Farmers typically prefer quicker
returns from any investment - and the fattening system enables them to realize returns
in around a year. Some farmers also stocked other carp species and tilapia along with
the major carps. However, the proportion of farmers who only stocked major carps
was low, even though these major carps are their target crop. Similar management is

                                                                                          25

               Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



also followed for other fish species. Farmers stocked other fishes along with highly-
valued fishes, pangas, and tilapia.

The FCR of carp targeted farming was 2.14 (Table 6). Although this was higher than
other targeted fish, farming is still profitable as the farmers sell comparatively larger-
sized fish at higher prices. FCRs of Pangas and Tilapia targeted farming were
comparatively low. Farmers are reluctant to use the feed in pangas and tilapia targeted
farming as their price is very competitive. The FCR of high-valued fish is very
comfortable for farming and is highly profitable. However, the consumers for these
species are fixed and limited. The increased production of the high valued species can
create imbalance in the demand and supply, which hampers the market
competitiveness.

Due to the low sample size for some of the categories, the results may vary from reality.
But the data shows a decreasing trend of FCR with increase of fish feed price. This
result reasonably explains some important insights. Medium-priced feed showed
better performance in fish farming. Farming performance was not satisfactory for the
farmers who applied high-priced feed. Furthermore, farmers may have been inefficient
in using feed (Table 7).

High stocking density shows better performance in feeding (Table 8). This means,
farming intensity gets better benefits from feed application. The FCR is comparatively
high in low intensive fish farming system; there may have been wastage of feed and
other animals may have obtained feeding from the ponds.

It was not possible to analyse the FCR with respect to water pH as most of the farmers
do not keep records and most of them do not measure pH levels. Although some
farmers provided data, it was not reliable. The FCR also depends on availability of
natural feed in the pond.

Based on combination of different types of feed application, the feeding patterns are
categorized as floating, sinking, floating and/or sinking, semi-auto and/or homemade,
and mix of different feeds. The performance of floating feed was better compared to
other combinations (Table 9). Some farmers are experienced in fish farming and they
use their expertise in feed application. These farmers applied different types of feed
based on the response of the feeding volume of fish. For example, low feeding in
winter, changing feeding frequency during rainy days, etc. Feeding efficiency of these
farms was comparatively better.

5.4 Contamination of feed and ingredients
Contamination (eutrophication/algal bloom) of ready-feed is reasonably low,
particularly when the feed is packed well after manufacturing. Normally the feed is
delivered to dealers immediately after manufacturing. The packaging is also very
sophisticated and possibilities of contamination (mycotoxin) is almost non-existent.
However, after a certain period of time, mycotoxin may grow.

Two types of raw materials (macro and micro) are used in the feed. The contamination
of micro-type raw materials (like additives) is very low due to the quality of packaging.
The contamination of macro type ingredients or raw material is high compared to other
types. Both imported and locally sourced macro ingredients are used in the feed.
There is a delay (of 10-30 days) to complete formal importing procedures. Imported
ingredients remain in the port facility during this time, and are often stored in open
places, leading to fungal infections. Furthermore, the delay may increase due to
holidays or other unexpected disruptions. Quality also deteriorates due to the addition
of extra moisture in some specific types of ingredients like maize, soybean etc.

Transportation system is another medium of contamination of ingredients. Locally
sourced ingredients are not loaded into transports in an organized way and are not
covered well to protect from unexpected rain in some cases. Heavy rain adds extra
water to ingredients in certain cases, causing deterioration in quality.


                                                                                                      27

              Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh




Employees of some feed companies are also reluctant during the unloading and
storage of raw materials. Since they unload a huge amount of raw material from
transport and store them next to one another on the same floor, they do not take proper
steps during the process. Furthermore, most of the factories have no skill development
training for the handlers on this issue. They are not careful in keeping ingredients
separate from each other as they think the ingredients will finally mix in the machine
anyway.

Fortunately, the situation is improving nowadays. Some feed companies have
appointed relevant staff members to reduce contamination of ingredients so that they
can ensure better quality of feed.

Farmers who make fish feed mixing locally available materials buy ingredients from
local shops. The shops manage the ingredients in their shop poorly, especially during
transportation and short-term storage (3-7 days). Rats often puncture sacks of
materials, but local shop owners do not take any necessary precautions. In addition to
this, the issue of contamination is also not clear to these shop owners.

5.5 Financial transaction
Money is generally paid through swift money transfer system of banks (pay order).
Both public and private banks are used for transactions. The traders do not use any
mobile financial services (BKash, Rocket, Nagad etc.) due to high service charge.
Although dealers buy feed in cash, they usually sell them in credit to the farmers. Some
farmers buy fish feed in cash from the dealers. Since traders sell fish feed in credit
and sales generally continue for an entire season or more, there is favourable platform
for the trader’s business. But the system limits farmers’ freedom of preference of
buying feed from other shops of the market.

5.6 Systemic health
5.6.1 Churn versus growth rate in the industry
Churn rate indicates the percentage of clients who walk away from the business and
growth rate indicates the opposite. Churn and growth rates can be compared to
determine if there is overall growth or loss in any industry. Like other sectors, the fish
feed market also lost its normal growth due to COVID-19 (Table 10).

5.6.2 Payment modality
Data related to payment modality were collected in June 2020. Fish feed traders buy
their products in different modality. Companies with higher brand value sell their
products in advance payment modality, known as telephonic transfer (TT) in the
market. Traders have to confirm their orders by sending money over TT. This is
applicable for dealers. Sub dealers and retailers, in most of the cases, buy their

                                                                                                28

           Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



products from dealers. In the market, most traders (around 90.6%) have to buy the
products through either advance cash payments or cash on delivery. In contrast, half
of the transaction value is in credit with their own clients.

5.6.3 Payment delay
In the supplier-trader-farmers chain, there is a gap in cash-flow. Traders get an
average 13 days for partial credit repayment, while their farmer-buyers take 89 days.
These 76 days partial credit gap is filled up by money from other businesses. In case
of full credit, there is a gap of 90 days between supplier and buyer credit repayments.
During in-depth interview, respondents explained that in most of the cases, the traders
have their own farms where they need feed. Since traders obtain feed at wholesale
rates, their cost for farming their own fish is decreased. This reduced amount is
subsidized in their business for credit repayment. Generally, a group of farmers pay
their dues every day. The paid amount is used to adjust the gap. The traders also
borrow money from other traders, relatives and neighbours for very short periods (for
one to seven days normally). Normally, no interest is paid for borrowing money in such
short stints. Around 38% traders borrowed money from bank, which is basically used
to adjust the gap. Sometimes, they adjust this trade gap with other businesses, for
example poultry feed, livestock feed, agricultural products etc. Around half of the
traders (47%) have other businesses. They adjust the gap managing money from the
other business (poultry feed, fish farming, fish hatchery, seed, fertilizer, poultry farming,
rice buy-sale, electronics, rice processing, restaurant, etc.) as well. The traders who
are comparatively affluent, they can easily adjust the gap of the cash flow.

The companies also face similar cash-flow gap. They ask ingredient traders to sell in
credit for short term. They also borrow money few times for very short period from
likeminded companies (for example, in case where owners are relatives or friends). In
some case they also manage money from cash credit (CC) loan. Cash credit is a
facility to withdraw money from a current bank account without having credit balance.

                                                                                                      30

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



However, withdrawal amount is limited, and the extent of limit is fixed by commercial
banks. The interest is not charged on the borrowing limit but on the daily closing
balance in this arrangement. The loan is interest free for a certain period.

5.6.4 Norms
Both formal and informal rules and norms are observed in the fish feed market. ‘Fish
Feed and Animal Feed Act, 2010’ is the main legislation in fish feed market of the
country. This act is a legislative guideline for fish feed processing, quality control,
import, export, marketing, sale, distribution, transportation and pertaining ancillary
matters. Besides, there is ‘Matshya Khaddo Bidhimala 2011’ (Fish Feed Rules 2011)
for the application of the act.

The fish feed trading market is mainly regulated by informal norms. As noted in the
previous section, since dealers conduct business activities in their own locality, most
of the clients are their acquaintances, relatives or neighbours. As a result, they have
to give some credit facility. The duration of repayment of credit depends on various
factors like trust, fish production cycle, relationship, kinship etc. In case of production
cycle, farmers pay after the fish are sold. Some farmers repay partially or fully during
the next purchase.

In some markets there is a well-accepted informal rule that retail price will be higher
during credit sales. On average, price of sales in credit was almost BDT 1.0 higher per
kilogram of feed.

Although top companies do not allow credit sales, some dealers reported that they can
arrange unofficial credit from the companies. This facility depends the on duration of
relationship and transaction history.

5.7 Access to finance
Rajshahi Krishi Unnyan Bank (RKUB) was established by the Government of
Bangladesh to support agricultural sectors in the Rajshahi division (Rangapur was also
part of the Rajshahi division at that time). Currently, there are 382 branches in the
Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. The Bank distributed BDT 2 thousand 59 crore
(US$248 million, where 1US$=BDT83) in 2019/20. US$2.43 (0.98%) of this amount
went to the fisheries industry. In addition, BDT 76 crores were also disbursed for
agriculture, while small proportions of it were for fish farming. Some private banks also
allow loan for fish farming, particularly for large farmers.

Generally, loans are diverted to the sector in which the demand is high. People want
quick returns from their investments through focus on retail oriented ventures (e.g.,
grocery shop, show shop etc.). Aquaculture takes long time to yield returns.
Consequently, people do not feel interested enough. However, with the introduction of
new technology which gives quicker returns (3-6 months production cycle), individuals
are now showing their interest in the fish farming. Some banks have also started to
take advantage of the opportunity.

The Bank also provides loans for fish trading and fish feed mills, which are the part of
fish industry. Both small and big feed mills borrow money from the bank. They borrow
loan for both capital investment and operating cost. Some zones are very prominent
for fish farming in the northern regions, like Gurudaspur under Natore, Rani Nagar

                                                                                           31

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



under Noagoan, Paba under Rajshahi etc. The financial institutions prefer to disburse
loan considering the zones.

Access to loan by marginalized farmers: Some banks (e.g., RKUB) has special
packages to provide loans for fish farming besides other agricultural products
cultivation. Around BDT 500,000 is the maximum limit. The following issues are
concerns in getting loan:

      The farmer should have his/her own pond. Some ponds have more than one
       owner and in most cases they are siblings. Such multiple ownership may
       disqualify farmers from availing loans.
      If an individual does not own a pond, loan is disbursed in case of leased ponds
       with some conditions. Documents for leased pond should be properly and
       clearly written. The document is not very clear for some leased ponds.
       Moreover, no proper document is maintained when the pond is leased in most
       cases.
      Most of the marginal farmers borrow loan from local NGOs for other purposes.
       They even borrow loan from more than one NGOs. When these farmers also
       apply for loan from banks like RKUB, they are disqualified as per policy.
      In some cases, when the authority visits the pond and report poor quality and
       unsuitable fish farming policy, they become disqualified.
      Some marginal farmers may have limitations in access to the staff of financial
       organizations in order to effectively get loans for fish farming. However, farmers
       do not report these cases. Higher authority of financial institutions is not always
       informed about such situations and as a result it becomes difficult to take action
       in this regard.

Some financial institutions have special loan packages for fish farming. These
institutions have been increasing the amount of loans disbursed every year and they
consider fish as very important sub-sector in Bangladesh. The banks also have
communication and promotional activities like hanging banner, poster distribution and
announcements to attract farmers for loan packages. Few banks also invite the
fisheries department in some of their selected meetings.

The policy of banks (public and private) fully support providing loan to fish farming as
a part of agricultural loan. As per policy, every farmer has full access to their bank.
However, the extent of access varies from bank to bank. Some private banks disburse
agricultural loan through local micro finance institutes.

In order to increase the coverage of agricultural loans (including loans for aqua culture),
banks and micro finance institutions have started to engage their staff to organize
monthly meetings with upazila and district level fisheries officials from the government.

On the other hand, farmers complained about limited access to loan for fish farming.
Lots of formal requirements and documentation are required to get the loan from
commercial banks. Assets like land are required as collateral to get the loan in some
cases. On average, 230 decimal land is required to borrow one hundred thousand
taka. Some documents like security PDC, asset/land documents etc., are also not well
known to the farmers and some factors are not clearly understood by them. Normally,
banks consider the value of land as 3-4 times lower than current market price for

                                                                                           32

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



collateral. Long processing time for disbursement also limits the access to loan.
Additionally, there are some allegations of unethical practices for loan processing.
According to the farmers it is easier to get loan from micro finance institutes. The
traders who need more money prefer private banks as access is easier than public
ones. Dealers also have access to buy products from respective companies in credit
for a very short period.

5.8 Documentation and digitalization
Most of farmers do not maintain any records of fish farming practices. Some large-
scale farmers maintain records in their own record books. They use mobile (cellular)
phones to communicate with suppliers of materials and fish buyers. Some large-scale
farmers use social media like YouTube to get information and updates regarding fish
farming. But all feed and input traders maintain structured binding cash books which
are available in the market for their book-keeping efforts. They maintain good
communications with fish-feed companies and farmers using both analog and smart
phones (call and text messaging). Most of the traders use both type of phones. None
of the fish farmers and traders use any special type of app or software.

They are habituated with the paper-based system and most of them do not feel the
need to digitize the system (KII with feed dealers).

But the fish feed mills use computers to maintain their records. Some small mills use
both hard copies and soft copies. They are habituated with using operational apps
attached with automatic machineries.

5.9 Feed quality control
Department of Fisheries (DoF) is responsible for monitoring feed quality. Every month,
a few feed companies (like ACI, Godrej, etc.) produce feed in two batches. As per the
law, they are bound to sell the feed into market after testing quality (through DoF on a
sample basis). In reality, however, a single test takes around two months. So the
company sells all the feed from all batches before getting the test results. They do
normally not wait for two months to get test results due to possibility of profit or loss
from their business.

Testing facilities are limited in government and autonomous organizations, including
some universities in northern Bangladesh. Cost for each test of sampled feed is BDT
3,500 in universities and other research institutes. On the other hand, it is around BDT
5,000 in DoF (KII with DoF, Paba, Rajshahi 2020). Testing facilities are only available
in the divisional level, not at the Upazila or District level. In some cases, the fund (to
monitor feed produced by companies) is also insufficient to test the feed as required.
DoF has realised that it needs at least one lab at district level so that they can test very
quickly.

5.10 Fish feed value chain
Fish feed manufacturers are highly dependent on the import of major fish feed
ingredients like soybean and maize.

Manufacturers normally sell their feed with help from dealers. They sell 95% of their
produced fish feed through their contracted dealers. Some large-scale farmers also

                                                                                           33

               Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



buy feed directly from manufacturers. Dealers also sell most of their feed (around 95%)
directly to farmers. Some retailers/sub-dealers are also found in the value chain who
buy and sell fish-feed in limited volumes (5%). Small-scale farmers buy fish-feed from
these retailers/sub-dealers. Both formal and informal financial institutions support
various stakeholders of the fish-feed value chain at a limited scale. Both public and
private banks provide financial support to manufacturers and ingredient importers
while micro finance institutes finance the sub-dealers/retailers and large farmers.
Some micro finance institutes, which are comparatively large, also finance some
dealers. Informal financing also exists in the system, including relatives, traders etc.
In most of the cases, they finance the business for a short period of time. The loaned
amount is also small.

7. Recommended interventions and the way
   forward
Challenge 1a: The local feed ingredient sellers are not aware enough about
contamination. They are inclined to keep the raw materials on the ground without care.
Training for local ingredients sellers would help to reduce the contamination.

Challenge 1b: A significant proportion of fish farmers prepare feed by buying
ingredients from the market and claim that the quality is better than that of ready feed.
To address the issue the following can be initiated:

Recommendation for Challenge 1a and 1b: A group of young individuals should be
employed as service providers (with pay) who will help farmers in preparing quality
feed. The group will also be responsible to inform about new technologies in the field
of fish-feed as part of quality services. It is also possible to provide information about
contamination of feed ingredients and how it important to prepare quality feed in a
similar manner. Farmers will be more careful in buying ingredients. As a result, there
will be gradual pressure on sellers to properly maintain the ingredients.

Department of Youth Development of Bangladesh provides training to the people on
different farming and business practices. They are also set up across the country.
Inclusion of a training module relate to fish feed in their training curriculum would help
to train the farmers on feed preparation and other important feeding issues.

Challenge 2: Certain groups of people manufacture fish feed of poor quality with the
help of local feed companies and they sell to the farmers. After a certain period of time,
they exit from the market to avoid accountability.

Recommendation for Challenge 2: The DoF needs to take initiatives in this regard.

Challenge 3a: Though loan is allowed for large-scale fish farming, small-size loans
are not allowed as returns are obtained after a long period of time (more than one and
a quarter year). With the help of advanced technologies, however, farmers are now
producing short-cycle pangas and tilapia. Carp fattening is also another short-cycle
technology.




                                                                                            36

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh



Challenge 3b: According to the financial institutions, farmers can apply for fish-
farming loans. This falls under agricultural loan packages. But the rules are not very
clear to the farmers.

Challenge 3c: Financial institutions are trying to increase access to loan for the
farmers. However, it is also true that it varies from staff to staff of the institutions.
Behaviour of some staff are not respectful to the farmers.

Challenge 3d: Sometimes, farmers face harassment from employees of financial
institutions while taking loan. But they are not aware about the process of lodging
complains. Most of the financial institutions do not even have a separate desk to
accept complains. Since the farmers do not feel comfortable to complain, higher
authority remains in the dark about this.

Recommendation for 3a to 3d: Input companies can take lead (as is being done by
different construction and real estate companies in Bangladesh) to solve the problem.
The companies which deal with both fish-feed and aqua-drugs are better. The
companies may obtain support through loan as they are selling feed and drugs to the
farmers. The company can get cash if the farmers have loans, which will increase their
transaction liquidity. These companies can give the farmers a clear idea on loan
process and support organizing required documents to proceed the loan. Since they
will accompany the farmers, the possibility of harassment from the concern staff will
be lower as well.

Some growing companies (e.g., I’Social) are also offering inputs’ packages for
different agriculture enterprises (like fish, dairy, rice, etc). They offer a package of
inputs (like feed, drugs etc) with improved practice services for a fixed price. They can
also be involved with the financing process of such farmers.

Challenge 4: Limited fish feed testing facilities are available in DoF facilities. It is
difficult to monitor feed quality without such facilities as it takes around 2 months to
process a single test.

Recommendation for Challenge 4: According to DoF, testing facilities up to at least
the district level, would speed up the process.

Ensuring third party testing facilities will solve the problem (similar to how the garments
factory in Bangladesh and other countries are testing quality from the authorized
testing laboratories). The DoF will authorize the party and the company will be
responsible to test their feed and submit the report to the DoF. The payment will be
made by the company to the third party. The third party will be accountable to the DoF
on how they are maintaining compliance.

Challenge 5: No actual data is available anywhere. The fish feed companies expect
to get data support on estimation of demand and supply so that they can make plans
accurately.

Recommendation for Challenge 5: Some companies in Bangladesh are trying to
develop some important databases and sell data access to the parties. The project
can search potential organizations which can help in this regard.

                                                                                           37

            Market Assessment and Business Analysis of Carp Feed in Northwest Bangladesh




Finding 1: Medium priced feed shows the best performance of fish farming (FCR).
Although farmers still use sinking-pellet feed, floating pellet resulted in the best
performance.

Recommendation for Finding 1: Farmers should be suggested accordingly in this
regard.

Finding 2: FCR of highly-valued fish is reasonable to conduct farming and is highly
profitable. But the consumers for these species are fixed and limited due to higher
price.
Recommendation for Finding 2: Increased production of the high valued species
can harm the balance of demand and supply, which will reduce the price. Farmers
should be more careful in this regard to save themselves from losses.

Challenge 6: New fish feed companies are entering in the fish industry every year.
This results in oversupply of feed, which is very difficult to sustain. Thus, some of them
are incurring losses their business.

Recommendation for Challenge 6: Long-term plan from the Government of
Bangladesh and FIAB with focus on the issue would help to grow the industry
efficiently and effectively.

Challenge 7: Collaboration among middlemen is very poor, resulting in lack of
business transparency.

Recommendation for Challenge 7: Initiative to strengthen horizontal collaboration
among these middlemen will help to increase information transparency. It is necessary
to increase the efficiency of the fish feed market. It is a contextualised idea that
business activities entail secrecy. But in reality, this idea does not result in better
outcomes. Yes, of course, some factors should remain confidential. But businesses
should understand which should be kept secret and which should be shared for the
betterment of their business.

Challenge 8: No one uses mobile banking system due to high transaction charges.
But these are quick service and are an efficient way to operate business activities
around the clock.

Recommendation for Challenge 8: Online payment platform specifically for farmers
where dealers will supply feed to the farmers for payment. This will speed up the
process and ensure transaction liquidity. As an indirect impact, this would help the
companies to reduce the price of feed.

Finding 3: Most fish feed traders maintain paper based accounting and other related
management system. Capacity building on how digital systems can speed up their
processes and increase business profits would be helpful.

Recommendation for finding 3: The feed companies can take initiatives to introduce
digital accounting systems.


                                                                                           38

Finding 4: Business cooperation is found to be poor among feed dealers as they are
competitors. As a result, short supply of feed occurs in some areas during uncertain
situations like lockdown, strike, etc.

Recommendation for finding 4: Digitization of supply chain can strengthen the
internal cooperation of the feed traders. Cooperation can minimize the supply and
demand gap for urgent needs. Business transaction can be conducted among the
traders.

Challenge 9: Nationwide feed production and marketing data is not available. In case
of limited data that is available, there are questions about reliability of data (quality,
timeliness, validity etc).

Recommendation for challenge 9: Collaboration between different associations and
government is necessary for data availability needed for market analysis. The process
will help the feed companies to forecast feed demand allowing them to avoid excessive
production.

Finding 5: Although fish farmers face risks in fish farming, no insurance programs
cover their risks. Insurance is available to support other businesses, but according to
the farmers, the process is complicated and not transparent.

Recommendation for finding 5: Recently, certain organizations are providing
services as a package. The package includes inputs and technical advice. The
companies can also work for linking farmers with insurance companies. If the service
providers will be engaged in the process, the process will be more transparent.

Finding 6: Although there is no significant trend of increasing fish-feed price, some
farmers are of the opinion that the feed price is high.

Recommendation for finding 6: Keeping this in mind, research on developing low
cost formulation of fish feed would help.

Finding 7: Some experienced farmers are not efficient in the application of fish-feed.

Recommendation for finding 7: Feed management app may help in this regard. The
feed traders may help through collaboration with feed companies.

Finding 8: There are limited embedded services on improved fish farming practices
for the farmers.

Recommendation for finding 8: Local service providers (LSP) are a great idea for
localizing the services. Different organizations like WorldFish, United Purpose etc.
already have experience working on similar initiatives. A lot of scattered shops are
available in remote areas. The shop keepers can be utilised as LSP for providing
technical services for efficient feed application. They can even help in the use of feed
management app.

It will be a good idea to set call centre by the feed company. This can also be their
marketing strategy under promotional activities.

                                                                                           39

There can be collaboration with Department of Youth to include efficient feed
management system in their curricula. They already have different on-going short-
term and long-term training programmes for the youth across the country. This would
be another process of disseminating knowledge on improved fish farming practices to
the farmers.

8. Conclusion
While aquaculture farming in northern Bangladesh has been expanding, fish feed
production and marketing are gradually getting importance. Both forward and
backward markets of fish feed become diversified. Existing challenges are becoming
more complex and critical, while new challenges are cropping up. These are carrying
barriers to smooth expansion of aquaculture industry. Small fish feed enterprises are
in difficult position to continue their business activities due to highly competitive
markets. A huge numbers of local feed traders even in remote areas is the strength of
the fish-feed markets. While a majority of the fish farmers are not efficient in feed use,
some experienced farmers in northern Bangladesh are dominating the fish feed
markets. A significant number of farmers prepare feed by themselves and apply to
their ponds, which is an issue for ready fish-feed available in the market. Keeping
these insights in mind, development and research initiatives would improve fish
production and feed market efficiency.
