  Preface

  Aquatic food systems continue to play a crucial role in nourishing billions of people globally. Fish-
  based diets are not only an important source of affordable animal-source protein but also help to
  address vitamins and micronutrient deficiencies in many developing countries. Fish value chains
  contribute substantially to socioeconomic development through income generation, employment
  creation, and poverty reduction. The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
  Development calls on all countries and stakeholders to work together to ensure sustainable
  improvement in human wellbeing. Achieving this ambition requires sustainable aquatic food
  systems, so that food supplies are stable and all people have access to adequate nutrition and
  health.

  Worldfish and Skretting have had a long standing collaboration to support and strengthened
  aquatic food systems through aquaculture development in Egypt. Among other important
  collaborative efforts, both have jointly engaged in vocational education and industry marketing
  campaigns. In 2016 the joint collaboration successfully led to the opening of a nutritional research
  unit based on the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) technology in Abbassa, Egypt.

  The shared vision between Skretting and Worldfish to promote the development of sustainable
  aquatic food systems culminated into the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in 2018 to
  formalize the partnership and commit to concerted action towards understanding and analysing the
  structure of the industry in African countries even better.

  Skretting and WorldFish have a joint interest in developing sound open access information on
  aquaculture farming systems, markets and performance of aquaculture products in Africa in order
  to better understand the impediments to aquaculture production in the region and to invest in the
  development, testing, adapting, and scaling solutions for bottlenecks. Both organizations have an
  interest in capacity building in order to underpin faster and more sustainable aquaculture
  development in the region.

  Joining forces to undertake carefully designed, rigorous, large-scale and comprehensive studies
  would provide faster access to reliable information and a better platform for multiple stakeholders
  including local and national governments, various actors along the fish value chain, and non-
  governmental organizations to attract the appropriate effort and investment to speed aquaculture
  development on the continent.

  This comprehensive baseline report on aquaculture performance assessment in Egypt is a direct
  result of the successful partnership between Skretting and WorldFish and we are grateful to the
  authors and all other contributors from both organizations. The report provides important insights
  about the current status of aquaculture in Egypt, identifies areas of urgent intervention in
  addressing constraints to aquaculture production, and serves as a good baseline against which
  future evaluations can be benchmarked.

  Abstract

  Aquaculture plays a crucial role in Egyptâs economic development contributing
  substantially to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. However, contexts
  are increasingly changing and characterized by shifts in dietary needs, more integrated
  value chains, globalization, population dynamics, and climate change. An enhanced
  understanding of aquacultureâs performance under these rapidly changing contexts is
  necessary. Yet the ability to generate the required knowledge is often constrained by
  lack of accurate data about integrated on-farm performance of aquaculture systems. In
  efforts to address this gap, the current study is a collaboration between WorldFish and
  Sketting to assess the on-farm performance of tilapia aquaculture systems in Egypt. A
  detailed baseline survey was implemented in Kafr el Sheikh Governorate covering 402
  tilapia aquaculture farm households. The baseline survey interviewed farm owners and
  managers. The information collected provides an important benchmark against which
  targeted interventions can be implemented and monitored to improve tilapia aquaculture
  production. Results show a tremendous increase in the number of tilapia aquaculture
  producers since 2014. There is also a notable increase in the adoption of modern
  extruded feed. We find significantly greater stocking densities (pieces/m2) in
  monoculture (3.9) than polyculture (3.4) systems. Although farmers practicing tilapia
  monoculture stock smaller-sized fingerlings compared to their polyculture counterparts,
  they reach the same harvest weight and obtain 20% higher yield than under polyculture.
  Results show that tilapia monoculture is 42% more profitable and 18% more cost-
  effective than polyculture systems. We do not find significant differences in productivity,
  profitability, and cost-effectiveness across different farm sizes. However, results show a
  growing trend in incidences of abnormal fish mortality. We also find that farmersâ
  perceptions of climate change and its impacts on tilapia aquaculture is very low.
  Similarly, farmersâ awareness of fish food safety certification is very low and only a few
  are interested to participate in such schemes if established. These results underscore
  the need for continued efforts and investments to promote aquaculture in Egypt.
  Specifically, the results on cost-effectiveness of tilapia culture present evidence about
  scalability of tilapia in Egypt. At the same time, interventions to promote wide scale
  adoption of aquaculture best management practices might help to reverse the trends in
  abnormal fish mortality in the immediate and medium term. In the long-term breeding for
  resilience traits will be crucial. There is also need for increased access to climate
  information services to improve farmersâ perceptions of climate change and its impacts
  in order to facilitate timely adaptation. The report discusses the implications of the study
  findings in detail.

  1. Introduction

  The crucial role of aquatic food systems including aquaculture on socioeconomic
  development and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is widely
  recognized in Africa. Although from a low initial base, the continent has the fastest
  growth in the global aquaculture sector, with an annual growth rate of above 9% in
  volume during the last decade. In Egypt, Africaâs leading aquaculture producer, recent
  evidence shows substantial contributions of the sector to improved human wellbeing
  through increased employment creation along the fish value chain (Nasr-Allah et al.,
  2020).

  However, the rapid development of aquaculture faces several challenges as well as
  numerous opportunities. Challenges include low production efficiency, disease outbreak
  risks, climate change, destruction of biodiversity and loss of natural resources and
  sensitive ecosystems (Walker and Winton 2010). Furthermore, globalization, aquatic
  food systems transformation, rapid changes in technological and institutional
  innovations, climate change, and environmental constraints have rapidly changed the
  context within which aquaculture operates. The challenges notwithstanding, there exist
  opportunities for strengthening livelihoods and contributing to food security and nutrition
  (FAO, 2018). Improving productivity, socio-economic, and environmental performance
  of aquaculture is an imperative to tapping these opportunities.

  An enhanced understanding of aquacultureâs performance under these rapidly changing
  contexts is necessary. Evidence-based performance assessment requires rigorous
  scientific data and information, without which our ability to generate the required
  knowledge is constrained. Therefore, increased efforts and investment in quality data
  collection for assessing performance of aquaculture systems is a fundamental first step
  towards such enhanced knowledge and evidence generation. The SkrettingâWorldFish
  collaborative baseline study is a contribution towards such efforts. Focusing on tilapia
  aquaculture in Egypt, the aim of the baseline study is to provide benchmark information
  against which the structure and evolution of aquaculture production and marketing
  systems are monitored and assessed. Information obtained from the study is crucial to
  support aquaculture investment decisions among farmers and enterprises in Egypt. In
  addition, baseline information is useful for WorldFish and Skretting to target
  interventions and to monitor and assess the progress and effectiveness of interventions
  designed for improved aquaculture performance.

  The baseline study is a descriptive cross-sectional data analysis to address two
  objectives: 1) to characterize tilapia aquaculture production systems; and 2) to assess
  productivity and profitability of tilapia aquaculture systems.

  2. Methodology

  2.1 Conceptual framework
  Production levels in aquaculture can be distinguished into three, namely potential,
  attainable, and actual (Zhengfei et al., 2006). Potential yield level is the highest
  production level achievable with the given physical environment and genetic
  characteristics of the fish and assuming no growth limiting and growth-reducing factors
  (Zhengfei et al., 2006). In the presence of growth limiting factorsâsuch as shortage of
  water and nutrientsâthe resulting yield is defined as attainable yield. Such factors can
  be controlled by the farmer. For example, the level of nutrients can be controlled by
  improved feeding to attain a level of yield. The attainable yield level assumes no growth-
  reducing factors such as diseases, poor quality of water, imperfect pond preparation,
  and non-optimal stocking densities. Growth-reducing factors lower the production level
  further to the actual yield level. Yield reduction can be controlled by yield-protecting
  inputs and measures such as the adoption of better management practices (BMPs). In
  field aquaculture production, nutrient supplies are rarely non-binding and thus potential
  yield is typically not observed in on-farm data.

  Empirical predictions for this study are guided by a framework integrating aquaculture
  insights into economic analysis. We dichotomize aquaculture inputs into: (1) growth
  inputs and (2) facilitating inputs. The former refers to inputs directly involved in the
  biological process of fish growthâland, water, fingerlings, and nutrients. The latter
  include inputs used to create favourable growth conditionsâpond preparation, stocking,
  applying fertilizers or exchanging water, disease prevention and control, and harvesting.
  This second category includes labour, capital, and disease control measures not directly
  involved in the basic biological processes of fish growth. Growth inputs contribute
  directly to fish growth, and their levels determine the attainable fish yield under given
  growth defining factors. Facilitating inputs affect yield indirectly by creating, controlling,
  or altering growth conditions under which growth inputs take effect. Based on the
  dichotomy of growth and facilitating inputs, fish production can be modelled as follows
  (Zhengfei et al., 2006):

  ð¦ = ð(ðº(ð¥1 , ð¥2 , ð¥3 , ð¥4 ; ð¸), ð¹(ð§1 , ð§2 , ð§3 , ð§4 ))                      (1)
                                                                                                       7
  where ð¥1 , ð¥2 , ð¥3 , ð¥4 are the growth inputs land, water, fingerlings, and feed, respectively;
  ð§1 , ð§2 , ð§3 , ð§4 are the facilitating inputs and include labour, fertilizer, capital, and disease
  and pests control chemicals, respectively. E represents growth environment, that is, the
  given growth-defining factors. In equation (1), growth inputs and facilitating inputs affect
                                                                                                           8
  fish-yield in a different way, reflected by the different functional forms of ðº(â) and ð¹(â).

  On-farm fish yield, unlike in controlled experiments, varies across farms because of
  differing growth conditions due to growth reducing factors, non-optimal pond conditions,
  and non-uniform input application (Zhengfei et al., 2006). Controlling for the growth
  conditions with ð¹(â), equation (1) makes it possible to estimate fish-growth function ðº(â)
  using real farm data, thereby extending aquaculture experiments into real-world field

  production.

  2.2 Sampling strategy
  The baseline survey was conducted in the governorate of Kafr El Sheikh, Egypt. The
  governorate was purposively selected to represent diverse tilapia aquaculture
  production systems, scale of production, and connectivity to consumption markets.
  Multi-stage and stratified random sampling techniques were applied to select 402
  aquaculture farmers in the governorate. The sampling frame comprised tilapia
  aquaculture producers. In the first stage, Four Markaz, namely Burullus, El Hamoul, El
  Ryad, and Sidi Salm (Figure 1) were purposively selected because of their popularity in
  Tilapia fish production. Within each Markaz, three separate lists of tilapia fish farmers,
  stratified by aquaculture farm size, were compiled: (1) list of farm households with
  aquaculture farm size less than 4.2 ha (10.4 Acres); (2) aquaculture farm size from 4.2â
  10 ha (10.4 â 24.7 Acres); and (3) aquaculture farm size larger than 10 ha. (24.7 Acres)
  There is no formal definition of aquaculture production scale. Nevertheless, the above
  three categories of farms represent a continuum of small-scale to medium and large
  scale aquaculture production in Egypt. Stratification by scale of farming is important
  because it relates to different productivity levels. Some Markaz were larger in population
  of tilapia aquaculture producers than others while within a Markaz, the proportions of
  small, medium, and large scale farmers may be skewed. In order to ensure
  representativeness, probability proportionate-to-size sampling was used, in the second
  stage, to randomly select 402 tilapia aquaculture farmers for personal interviews.

  2.3 Data collection
  A baseline survey was conducted during SeptemberâDecember 2019 interviewing farm
  owners and managers. Data collection captured the different aspects of fish farming and
  the livelihoods of the farmers. Specifically, the survey questionnaire included the
  following modules, important for an integrated performance assessment: demographic
  characteristics; details of aquaculture production including quantity and sources of
  inputs, revenue, expenses, labor composition, fish mortality rate, and aquaculture
  management practices; perceptions and adaptation to climatic shocks; food security
  and diet diversity; food safety and certification; access to information and credit; risk
  preference; household expenditure; asset and housing conditions; and subjective
  wellbeing.

  The questionnaire was programmed into KoBo Tool Box for computer-assisted personal
  interviews (CAPI) using mobile phone tablets. Before the actual survey, the electronic
  version of the questionnaire was pre-tested and adjusted accordingly to fit the local
  context. Three sessions were held to train the field team in quality data collection. The
  first session provided detailed explanation of the survey and questionnaire using the
  paper version. During role-playing, enumerators paired to practice the survey and to
  suggest further improvements of the questionnaire. Upon full understanding of the
  paper version of the questionnaire, the second session trained on how to collect data by
  using mobile phone tablets. The final session involved piloting of the surveys in order to
  give the enumerators an opportunity to collect data using mobile phone tablets in an
  actual setting.

  In order to ensure quality data collection, a mechanism for quality checks was
  established. Enumerators uploaded the data collected to the server at the end of each
  survey day. A research analyst at WorldFish then downloaded the data and checked for
  any potential mistakes and inconsistencies. Timely feedback about any issues detected
  was provided to the field coordinator who subsequently worked with the enumerators to
  solve the problems.

  2.4 Data analysis
  Descriptive analysis was used to address the first objective to characterize aquaculture
  systems. Characterization was based on the following: monoculture versus polyculture;
  size of pond; inputs used including stocking densities, types of feeds and amounts
  applied; use of other inputs including fertilizer, chemicals, and labour; additional
  expenses; abnormal fish mortality; pond water and disease management; perceptions
  and adaptation to climate change; and fish food safety.

  In order to address the second objective, analysis combined descriptive statistics and
  comparative analysis by farming systems. Analysis included cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
  to assess the performance of aquaculture systems under monoculture and polyculture
  systems as well as comparing three categories of farms (<4.2 ha; 4.2â10 ha; and >10
  ha). Tilapia gross revenue was measured as value of tilapia production computed as
  yield of tilapia harvested (kg/ha per cycle) multiplied by the selling price (US$) for a kg

                                                                                                9

  of tilapia. We also measure the value of all other fish production. Finally, we calculate
  total gross fish revenue by summing revenue from tilapia and revenue from other fish
  species. The inputs included three growth inputs: pond size, fingerlings, and feed, and
  four facilitating inputs: labor, fertilizer, capital, and other chemicals (e.g., water treatment
  chemicals). Pond size was measured in hectares. The rest of the inputs were measured
  in US$ using the World Bankâs 2019 official exchange rate for Egypt (US$1=EGP17.06).
  Labour cost was calculated as follows. First, we consider three types of labor, namely
  family, hired part-time, and hired full-time. For each type of labor, male and female
  person-days were computed. Cost for hired labor was obtained by multiplying the total
  number of person days by the median daily wage for the specific type of labor.

  3. Results
  3.1 Descriptive summary statistics
  Table 1 presents descriptive summary statistics of sample respondents. Majority (84%)
  of the sample respondents were farm managers. Aquaculture production is
  predominantly a menâs activity: 99% of the sample respondents were male with an
  average age of 44 years and 17 years of experience in aquaculture production.
  Experienced farmers may have an enhanced ability to implement new technologies and
  practices subsequently contributing to increased productivity through learning-by-doing.

  About three-quarters (74%) of the sample respondents had completed at least primary
  school education. Education is important to increase farmersâ ability to actively search
  for and implement new aquaculture knowledge and technologies and can contribute
  positively to productivity.

  The total amount of land allocated to aquaculture was 5.4ha, on average. All sample
  respondents practiced pond aquaculture and 82% practiced polyculture. The most
  commonly cultured speciesâin addition to tilapia (all sample respondents farmed
  tilapia)âincluded Mullet capito (70%) and Mullet cephales (54%). Respondents were
  further asked to indicate whether and how they would reallocate land to different
  enterprises and activities if freely allowed to. On average, respondents indicated they
  would allocate 98% of their land under aquaculture, 0.3% to crops production, 1.5% to
  other activities, and 0.1% would be rented out. This shows that aquaculture is the
  primary and most important livelihood activity among sample respondents.

  4.2 Stocking, survival, and yield
  Results of stocking, survival rates, and yield for the three main cultured species are
  summarized in Table 2. The average stocking density for tilapia is 3.5 fingerlings per
  square meter at weight of 2.3g per fingerling. However, the weight of tilapia at stocking
  varies a lot among farmers. The corresponding stocking densities for Mullet capito and
  Mullet cephales are 0.4 pieces/m2, and 0.2 pieces/m2, respectively. On average, four
  out of five tilapia fingerlings (79%) stocked survives to maturity and are harvested at
  326g yielding 8,783kg/ha per cycle.

  Table 3 focuses on tilapia and presents results comparing between monoculture and
  polyculture systems and across different sizes of ponds. Results indicate that farmers
  practicing monoculture stock considerably more tilapia fingerlings than those under
  polyculture whereas the latter stock larger-sized fingerlings than the former. Tilapia
  yields are 20% higher under monoculture (10.5t/ha per cycle) than polyculture system
  (8.4t/ha per cycle). The obtained average yields are similar with those reported by Nasr-
  Allah et al. (2020) who documented average yields equal to 10.3 t/ha per year. A few
  studies have also found higher yields of tilapia under monoculture than polyculture
  systems in Egypt (Hebicha et al., 2013; Nasr-Allah et al., 2019). Differences in stocking
  density, survival rate, and yield of tilapia are not statistically significant across different

  4.3 Profitability of aquaculture systems
  This section evaluates the profitability and cost effectiveness of aquaculture systems.
  Measures of profitability included gross margin, defined as gross return less total
  variable cost or return over variable cost; and return on variable cost, measured as
  gross margin divided by total variable cost. Total variable cost and return on variable
  cost were used to assess cost effectiveness.

  Table 4 presents the costs and returns of aquaculture production by culture system and
  across different aquaculture farm sizes. The average selling price of tilapia equals
  EGP22/kg (US$1.29). The value of fish yields is US$17,159 for monoculture and
  US$14,807 for polyculture. The value of fish yields is statistically the same between
  tilapia monoculture and polyculture systems and across the different pond size
  categories. We find that tilapia aquaculture is profitable. Returns and costs of tilapia
  aquaculture vary substantially by culture system, but not across pond size categories
  (Tables 4 and 5). Results indicate returns over variable costs (gross margins) equal to
  US$8,558 for monoculture corresponding to 42% greater (p-value < 0.05) gross margins
  than those obtained under polyculture (US$4,960). Furthermore the benefitâcost ratio is
  2.2 and 1.8 for monoculture and polyculture respectively (p-value < 0.1) suggesting
  greater cost effectiveness under monoculture than under polyculture.

  4.4 Fish feeding
  The survey module on feed use and cost asked about the types of feed applied, the
  source of feed, distance (km) to the source of feed, quantity of feed applied, the price of
  feed, cost of transporting feed from source to farm, and the protein content (%) where
  possible. The main type of feed applied is extruded feedâ96% of sample respondents
  applied this feed (Figure 2). Fifteen percent of the sample respondents indicated they
  applied pellet feed. Other types of feed include company waste (0.5%), flour (2.7%),
  and farm-made feed (0.2%). Among farmers applying extruded and pellet feed, the
  quantity applied equals 10.9t/ha for extruded feed and 6.2t/ha for pellet feed per cycle.
  Results comparing feed use between monoculture and polyculture systems are
  presented in Table 6. The quantity of extruded feed applied is significantly higher in
  monoculture than polyculture systems (p-value < 0.05) whereas use of pellet feed is
  statistically the same between monoculture and polyculture systems. Figure 3 presents
  histograms of quantity of extruded and pellet feed used. As shown the distribution of the
  quantity of extruded feed applied is skewed to the right while that of pellet feed is
  skewed to the left confirming greater use of extruded than pellet feed.

                    feed and pelleted feed, respectively, from a feed dealer. The average price of extruded
                    feed is US$0.48/kg and that of pelleted feed is US$0.41/kg (Table 7). Farmers travel a

  either applying pellet feed only or pellet feed plus extruded feed. At the same time, the
  variable cost of production is highest for farmers using extruded feed only and lowest for
  farmers using pellet feed only. The difference in variable cost of production is
  statistically significant at 1% level. Results in Table 9 shows that the protein content is
  higher in extruded feed than in pellet feed.

  4.5 Water exchange and sediment disposal
  Analysis of water exchange and sediment disposal was conducted based on a sub-
  sample of respondent for whom we have pond-specific data. Our definition of water
  exchange excludes cases where water flow in and out of the pond constantly or water
  changes through overflow or flooding without farmers having to do it themselves. Most
  of the sample respondents (93%) practiced water exchange. On average, farmers
  exchanged water more than 5 times during the last cycle before the survey (Figure 5).
  The average water exchange rate was 0.3m each time. However, we do not have

  information about the sources of water for exchange. Water is mostly disposed in
  irrigation canals and drainage channels (Figure 6). The point of disposal of water and
  sediments has implications for environmental impacts although results in Tables 4 and 5
  show that expenditure on chemicals is low indicating minimal usage. Probiotics were the
  commonly used chemicals (Figure 9). Forty-eight percent of sample respondents
  disposed sediments from their fish ponds. Most farmers removed sediments after one or
  two cycles (Figure 7). Sediments are mostly disposed on pond dykes and irrigation
  canals (Figure 8) while only 15% of the sample respondents using the sediments on
  crop fields, suggesting an underutilised resource.

  4.5 Abnormal fish mortality
  Respondents were asked whether they had experienced abnormal fish mortality in the
  last five years before the survey. Abnormal mortality was broadly defined as a loss of
  fish that makes the farmer worried. For, example a farmer losing five percent of his fish
  at once. However, if the five percent is lost say over a span of nine months, it should not
  be consider as abnormal mortality. Abnormal mortality can also mean a loss of fish that
  starts and increases in intensity hence getting the farmer worried about the situation.
  Results in Figure 10 (left panel) show that 13% of the sample respondents reported
  having experienced abnormal mortality of fish during the period 2014â2018. Figure 10
  (right panel) shows an upward trend in abnormal fish mortality since 2014.

  Farmers identified poor water quality (due to pollution or ammonia, low oxygen e.t.c.)
  and bacterial diseases (Figure11) as the main causes of abnormal fish mortality. This
  may partly explain the use of probiotics and antibiotics. Other causes of abnormal fish
  mortality include high humidity, very low water depth, prolonged exposure to abnormal
  water temperature, sudden changes in temperature, and stress during grading. One-

   4.6 Farmer perceptions and adaptation to climate variability
  Global climate change is increasingly threatening aquaculture activities (Ahmed and
  Diana, 2016; Barange et al., 2018). The baseline survey module on climate change,
  therefore, asked questions about farmersâ perceived changes related to climate,
  adaptation measures implemented to address or cope with climate-related shocks, and
  planned future adaptation. About half of the sample respondents have not observed any
  changes related to climate (Figure12). The most commonly reported climatic stress
  include extreme hot temperature, extreme low temperature, heat waves, and rapid
  changes in temperature.

  Figure 12. Perceived changes in climate
  How are climate-related changes affecting aquaculture farming systems and
  livelihoods? Figure 13 presents results of farmersâ perceived impacts of climate change.
  As shown, about one-fifth of farmers observing climate-related changes indicated that
  there was no impact at all on their farming systems or livelihoods. The most commonly
  reported impacts of climate change include low productivity, frequent occurrence of
  disease incidences, reduced availability of water, poorly aerated pond water, and
  abnormally high pond water temperature (Figure13).

  Adaptation is crucial to address impacts of climate change and variability on
  aquaculture and therefore improve performance. Figure 14 presents the actions taken
  by farmers to address climate change and variability. Adaptation to climate change and

                                                                                                                                                   25

  variability is generally low. One-quarter of the farmers perceiving climate change made
  no adjustment at all in their aquaculture farming activities in response. Only six percent
  harvested their fish prematurely, three percent monitored water quality, another three
  percent exchanged water or refilled the ponds, and 0.8% reduced feeding.

  Respondents were further asked to indicate, on a Likert scale, the extent to which they
  believed climate change would continue to occur in the future. Most of the sample
  respondents (74%) were unsure or did not know about the likelihood of climate change
  happening in the future (Figure 15). Only 4% of the sample respondents indicated that
  climate change was unlikely to happen in the future. Results show that 20% of the
  respondents perceive that climate change is somewhat likely or likely to happen.
  Perception of future climate change can influence not only current adaptation, but also
  planning and adaptation in the future. About three-quarters of the sample respondents
  perceiving that climate change will likely happen in the future, however, think that there
  will be no adverse impacts at all or that such impacts will be small (Figure 16) while the
  remaining quarter perceive medium to strong impacts. Consequently, very few farmers
  indicated that they intended to make changes in their aquaculture activities in order to
  address future climate change impacts.

  In addition to farmer-identified adaptation measures, we further probed for farmersâ
  awareness and use of adaptation strategies identified by literature on climate change
  adaptation in aquaculture. These included digging of deeper ponds, lining of ponds to
  retain water better, lining of ponds to avoid salinity, raising the bunds of ponds to
  control flooding, introduction of stress-tolerant strains, stocking of larger size of
  fingerlings, improved feed management, improved water quality management,
  improved disease and fish health management, and improved postharvest handling.
  Figure 17 shows awareness exposure about these additional adaptation strategies is
  very low. Where awareness was relatively high, for example in the case of stress-
  tolerant strains of fish, actual implementation of the adaptation strategy was very low.
  This suggests that other factors beyond awareness exposure may constrain effective
  adaptation to climate change and variability.

  4.7 Food security and consumption of fish
  We asked respondents to describe a typical food year for their households. For each
  month, respondents indicated whether the food they consumed was mainly from their
  own farms or from outside their farms. They further indicated the months of the year
  when they did not have enough food to feed the household. Figure 18 presents the
  monthly food security situation. We observe that households mainly rely on food coming
  from outside their own farms until end of July. Beginning August until end of November,
  there is an increase in the proportion of households obtaining food from their own farms.
  However, the proportion of household obtaining food outside their own farms remains
  below 20% even for the month with the highest case (November). Furthermore, most
  households did not experience a situation of food deficit.

  (Figure 19). Most sample respondents (94%) consumed fresh fish (Figure 20). Most of
  the consumed fish is purchased from fish markets (56%) and main markets (33%) while
  only one-tenth is sourced on-farm from own production (Figure 21).

  4.8 Information, credit, and participation in farmer group
  Access to credit and information as well as participation in farmer group influence the
  enabling environment within which aquaculture production takes place. We asked study
  respondents whether they had applied for credit during 12 months preceding the survey.
  This question can help to assess whether farmers are faced with liquidity constraints
  and whether there is demand for credit. A follow up question asked whether the credit
  was received. We find that very few farmers had asked for credit. Results also show
  very low participation of farmers in aquaculture groups and limited access to weather

  4.9 Risk preference, subjective wellbeing, and aspirations
  People can behave differently in different situations of risk. Farmersâ risk attitudes may
  influence the likelihood to adopt improved aquaculture technologies and practices,
  consequently influencing performance. Using a scale from zero (a person who fully
  avoiding risk) to nine (a person fully prepared to take risks), respondents were asked to
  rate themselves in terms of willingness to take risks. Figure 22 presents a distribution of
  the risk scores. The average rating was 4.9 indicating that most sample respondents
  are risk-neutral.

  In order to assess subjective wellbeing, we began by asking all sample respondents to
  indicate the year when they were happiest and that when they were least happy.
  Results are presented in Figure23. Most farmers were happiest in 2014 and 2015 while
  2018 and 2017 are the years when farmers were least happy. Next, respondents were
  asked to indicate the very lowest net monthly income that their households would
  require in order to make ends meet. On average, sample respondents reported they
  would need at least EGP8,535 (US$500) net monthly income in order to make ends
  meet. Respondents were then shown a picture of a ladder. They were told to imagine
  that at the bottom step, stood the poorest people, and on the highest step, stood the
  richest in their villages. They then indicated the step of the ladder on which their
  households were located? A follow up question asked, âIf the latter now represents
  wealth in Egypt, on which step of this ladder is your household located?â The different
  rungs of the ladder were labelled zero (lowest rung) to nine (highest rung). Figure 24
  presents the results of the subjective wealth ratings. Most sample respondents rated
  their wealth relative to that of co-villagers and fellow citizens as medium. At higher
  ratings, however, the distribution of wealth relative to co-villagers is above that of wealth
  relative to fellow citizens.

  When asked what they thought about differences in standards of living in their villages,
  67% indicated that the differences were average, 20% reported somewhat small or very
  small while 13% indicated somewhat large or very large differences (Figure25). Figure
  26 presents farmersâ perceptions about the gap between the rich and the poor in their
  villages. More than two-thirds of the sample respondents perceived that the gap
  between the rich and the poor in their village had not changed over the last five years
  while 24% indicated that it had narrowed. About 10%, however, felt that the gap
  between the rich and the poor had widened.

  Figure 27 presents results of farmersâ aspirations. Furthermore, most of the sample
  respondents perceived no change in their wellbeing in last 12 months and last five years
  before the survey. Majority also believed that their wellbeing would remain the same in
  the following year and five years after the survey. A follow up question asked the extent
  to which farmers thought their household average monthly net income would change in
  the next 12 months after the survey. Results in Figure 28 support those in Figure27;
  most farmers indicated that their net monthly income would remain the same.

  4.9 Food safety and willingness to participate in certification
  Interventions aimed at minimizing potential health hazards within food-producing
  sectors including aquaculture are necessary for increased contribution to
  socioeconomic development. The baseline survey, therefore, included a module on fish
  food safety. We find that farmers mostly perceive quality or safe fish to mean one with
  good taste, that can stay longer without going bad, and that does not cause diseases
  (Figure 29). Only 9% of our sample respondents did not know what safe or quality fish
  means. The leading source of information about food safety is fellow farmers suggesting
  the role of social learning and fish food safety information diffusion within networks
  (Figure 30). Other sources of information include research stations and television. We
  further asked farmers about the measures they implemented to ensure supply of good
  quality fish safe for human onsumption. The main measures followed (Figure 31)
  include reduced use of chemicals (65%), proper drying of fish (43%), and selling
  immediately after harvesting (26%). Certification for fish food safety can help to improve
  food safety. We not only find low awareness among farmers about certification for fish
  food safety, but also low interest to participate in certification schemes if established
  (Figure 32).

  Discussion and Conclusion
  Aquaculture continues to play a crucial role in socioeconomic development in many
  developing countries. Contexts are, however, changing and increasingly characterized
  by globalization, more integrated value chains, rapid technological and institutional
  change and innovations, climate change, and environmental constraints. An enhanced
  understanding of aquaculture performance within these changing contexts requires
  increased investment in quality data collection for an integrated assessment. In
  response to this need, WorldFish in partnership with Skretting conducted a baseline
  survey with the aim to characterize aquaculture production systems and measure
  productivity, profitability, and environmental impacts. The baseline survey focused on
  tilapia aquaculture producers and interviewed farm owners and managers. The
  information collected provides an important benchmark against which targeted
  interventions can be implemented and monitored.

  Baseline analysis showed that the number of farmers practicing aquaculture has
  increased tremendously since 2014 and that most farmers would allocate almost their
  entire farm size to aquaculture production if freely allowed to do so. This emphasizes
  the importance of aquaculture on improved livelihoods and socioeconomic development
  in Egypt. Majority of tilapia farmers practice polyculture. However, results show that
  monoculture systems perform better than polyculture in terms of yields, profitability, and
  cost effectivess. With the caveat that our study does not measure fixed costs and
  therefore potentially overestimates profitability, these results suggest a clear business
  case for investment in tilapia aquaculture. The finding that differences in profitability and
  cost-effectiveness across farm sizes is not significant indicates clear distributional
  benefits associated with tilapia aquaculture. Specifically, these results indicate that
  tilapia is a beneficial investment both to small scale and large scale farmers. Cost-

                                                                                                                           38

  effectiveness further implies the potential for scaling tilapia aquaculture in the country.

  Farmers mostly feed fish on extruded feed purchased directly from feed companies (in
  most cases). This indicates increased adoption of modern extruded feeds. Use of other
  inputs including fertilizer and chemicals is low. Water exchange is a common practice
  among tilapia farmersâwater is mostly discharged in irrigation canals and drainage
  channels. However, there is need for a follow up study to examine sources of water
  used for exchange and the quality of the water. For example, higher ammonia levels in
  water inlets than in ponds can cause fish health problems. Indeed poor quality of water
  was identified as a major cause of abnormal mortality of fish, which has increased
  sharply since 2015. Abnormal fish mortality is also attributed to bacterial diseases. Our
  survey did not collect data about the type of bacteria causing abnormal mortality of fish.
  However, we observed that antibiotics were among the commonly used chemicals. Still,
  we did not assess the effectiveness of such antibiotics in addressing the bacterial
  disease problems. About half of the sample respondents remove sediments from their
  ponds. This is done mostly after one or two cycles and the waste is disposed on pond
  dykes and irrigation canals. That sediments are mostly disposed on dykes instead of
  crop fields potentially implies an underutilized resource. However, there is need to
  investigate further the underlying motivation for disposing sediments on dykes as
  opposed to crop fields.

  Awareness exposure about adaptation to climate change and variability is very low.
  Most farmers are uncertain about occurrence of climate change in the future and think
  that impacts will only be small or none at all. If farmers do not perceive climate change,
  adaptation action may not be prioritized presently and in the future. Yet there is
  mounting evidence for immediate climate action to enhance resilience of aquatic food
  systems. Our findings possibly suggest the need for increased investment in the
  provision of climate information services to farmers to not only improve perceptions but
  also behaviour.

  Interventions aimed at minimizing potential health hazards within food-producing
  sectors including aquaculture are necessary for increased contribution to
  socioeconomic development. Our results show that farmers are currently implementing
  a number of approaches to ensure fish food safety. However, knowledge about and
  interest to participate in fish food safety certification is very low. This finding perhaps
  indicates the need for increased knowledge diffusion about food safety. There is also
  need for follow up research to assess consumersâ demand for fish food safety
  certification. This will indicate whether there exists a premium in the market as an
  incentive for producers to engage in quality improvement practices.

  These findings have important implications policy and efforts targeted to improve
  performance of aquaculture systems in Egypt. Aquaculture is welfare-enhancing
  through increased net incomes and enhanced food security. Interventions aimed at
  increase input use efficiency will help to improve cost-effectiveness of polyculture
  systems and to boost profitability. There is also need for better management of pond
  water and waste in order to maximize environmental benefits. Furthermore, increased

  adoption of aquaculture best management practices is important to reverse the
  increasing trend in losses caused by abnormal fish mortality.
