EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Feed the Future Bangladesh Aquaculture and Nutrition Activity (BANA), also referred as the
Activity, is a 5-year award made by USAID and implemented by WorldFish since February 2018. Feed
the Future has the goal of achieving inclusive aquaculture sector growth through a market systems
approach in the Feed the Future Zone of Influence (ZOI) and Zone of Resilience (ZOR). WorldFish
assigned Consiglieri Private Limited (CPL) to conduct the baseline study based on the seven indicators
leading to the intended results of the activity and current aquaculture situation in Feed the Future ZOI
and ZOR.

The main objective of this study was to collect and analyze the existing situation of aquaculture sector
of ZOI and ZOR in line with the indicators outlined in the BANA Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning
(MEL) plan. The baseline value will guide BANA to measure its achievements and outputs over the
period of implementation. This will also help devise appropriate monitoring tools for the Activity’s
interventions. The study conducted a total of 45 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), 14 Focused Group
Discussions (FGDs) for the qualitative part and 1726 interviews for the quantitative part. For carp
farmer survey, the study was conducted in 30 upazilas in 15 districts and for Tilapia farmers it was
conducted in 18 upazilas under nine districts.

The research team implemented a mixed-methods evaluation design with a combination of qualitative
and quantitative data collection methodologies. The qualitative component consisted of a desk
review, KIIs, and FGDs with fish farmers and related market stakeholders of fish value chain. The
quantitative component consisted of questionnaire survey with fish farmers.

The target population sampled was from the Feed the Future ZOI which included 5 districts in Dhaka,
10 districts in Khulna, and 6 districts in Barishal division. Also, Cox’s Bazar and Bandarban were
included from Chattogram division as part of the ZOR. The primary respondent group was the farmers
or farming households producing Tilapia and carp including women and youth in their production
process. At the market level, there were six major types of market actors- hatcheries, nurseries,
inputs/feed manufacturers, dealers/sub-dealers and retailers, and fish traders. Regulatory level actors
included government officials of Department of Fisheries (DoF) and Bangladesh Fisheries Research
Institute (BFRI).

This study considered 13 different species of carp along with Tilapia which are commonly cultured in
the study region. Prawn is also cultured very frequently in these areas. The carp and Tilapia farmers
culture prawn mixed with carp and Tilapia for extra profit opportunities. The baseline study has found
that the carp farmers cultured on an average 74 decimals of pond and the Tilapia farmers (most of
whom are commercial farmers) used an average of 130 decimal for fish culture. Overall, male farmers
had more land ownership and better production than that of female farmers for both carp and Tilapia.

For stocking purposes, the most preferred fish species are carps (Rui, Catla, Mrigal, Silver carp, Grass
carp) and Tilapia among the respondent farmers. It is evident that around 71 percent farmers (both
carp and Tilapia) selected fish species based on the pond condition, culture system and expected profit
margin of the fish. The research team also found that farmers considered the feeding habit of fishes
at different levels of pond depth by the fish species to ensure optimum feed utilization and reduced
competition among the different fish species.

On an average, the farmers were found to stock 40 carp fingerlings per decimal-- approximate cost
BDT 287. Similarly, farmers stocked 145 pieces of Tilapia fry per decimal (cost BDT 165). From the
baseline survey, it was found that most farmers lack knowledge about the stocking related practices.
Less than half of the carp and Tilapia farmers knew about the practice of checking and around two
                                                                                                           v

thirds of the farmers did not check their quality of the last seed stocking. Less than half of the farmers
acclimatized or adapted the fish fingerlings to the water before stocking. And with the dearth of
technical knowledge, farmers were found to estimate stocking density based only on water area in
decimals.

In the study, production cost was assessed by determining the fixed and input costs for both carp and
Tilapia farmers. Among the fixed costs, both farmers invested considerably in dewatering and drying
equipment to maintain the water quality of pond and fencing nets surround the pond dykes to prevent
fish from escaping during flooding and to restrict the entry of predator fish and other animals. In case
of input costs, carp and Tilapia farmers had mixed practices in feeding and a combination of feeds
were used. They use both homemade and supplementary feed at the initial stage of culture and later
use commercial feed before harvesting to ensure better growth and production of fish; especially in
case of Tilapia farmers. Some farmers depend only on homemade and raw supplementary feed to
minimize the production cost. The frequency of feeding varies seasonally; both fish farmers provide
less feed in winter compared to monsoon.

It is difficult for the smallholder farmers to provide feed on a regular basis since the price of feed is
high and cash flow is a challenge. Farmers with limited knowledge about fish feeding used non-pellet
feeds to minimize the feeding cost. More than 50 percent of the farmers use commercial or locally
made pellet feeds. Occasionally they also use other supplementary feeds in their raw form to reach
desired production and minimize feed cost. Based on the farmers’ information, the study estimates
that the Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) is 1.43. Most of the farmers cannot provide an adequate amount
of feed, do not maintain the harvesting cycle and use mixed feeding applications. As a result, it was
difficult to establish accurate FCR. Generally, most carp and Tilapia farmers use lime as disinfectant
agent to keep pond environment and water clean. Both carp and Tilapia farmers also use some
medicine to prevent diseases and improve dissolved oxygen condition.

The study looked into the harvest, yield, and sales of both carps and Tilapia. Since the farmers source
inputs on credit or with loans, they need to harvest multiple times to be able to repay their loans and
credit. Carp and Tilapia farmers produce fish for Household (HH) consumption, gifts and commercial
business. In 2018, the average fish consumption per HH was 130 kg/HH. From the total harvest, Tilapia
farmers sold 93 percent and carp farmers sold 84 percent of total yield. As Tilapia is cultured mostly
for commercial purpose, the rate of HH consumption and gifting was less when compared to carp. It
was found that, the average yield per hectare (ha) was 2,475 kg/ha for carp farmer and 3,770 kg/ha
for Tilapia farmers. Commercial farmers used high quality inputs and improved technology and
practices and, as a result, got higher yields.

From the gender perspective, it was found that female farmers mostly culture fish only for HH
consumption, and their yield is comparatively low. The study also found that young farmers (15-29
years) have less experience, but because they adapt the latest and improved technology for fish
culture and are more likely to take risks, they are able to get better yields. The average yield per HH
for carp farmers was 758 kg/HH and for Tilapia farmers 2,042 kg/HH. The total volume of yearly sales
per HH were estimated based on the gender and age of the fish farmers, and the volume of yearly
sales is higher for male fish farmers (662 kg/ HH for carp and 1,975kg/HH Tilapia farmers). The sales
volume is comparatively much lower for the female farmers who are generally not engaged in
commercial farming, mainly culturing fish for the home. Younger fish farmers adopt improved
technology for commercial Tilapia culture more readily and tend to get higher yields than older
farmers (aged 30+ years). The average price of carp and Tilapia fish was BDT 132/kg and BDT 102/kg
respectively in 2018.

Major problems faced by farmers are in getting goo quality fry or fingerling, procurement and sourcing
of feed. For both carp and Tilapia, around 41 percent farmers were found to be aware of the quality

                                                                                                             vi

variations in seed and feed. This means 59 percent of farmers did not even know about the variation
in quality of seed and feed, that there are higher quality of seed and feed available other than what
they used. So these farmers could not report on whether there were actually any problems in their
seed and feed quality. For both carp and Tilapia, the major problems are the unavailability of fish fry
and fingerlings, not getting good-sized, and uniform fry or fingerling and the high mortality rate of fish
fingerlings; (the fry or fingerling are stressed during transportation from nursery to farm).

In case of access to finance, it was found that the farmers take loans from Micro Finance Institutions
(MFIs), banks, input sellers, family and friends, mohajon (local money lender), output arotders (market
aggregators), and cooperatives. MFIs are the principle source of finance for both the carp and Tilapia
farmers. Tilapia farmers take larger loans than carp farmers as they are mostly commercial and require
larger investment. 15 percent of the male farmers and 13 percent of the female farmers access these
financial services.

This study has a gender emphasis and found that 90 percent of women respondents participated in
household activities related to fish culture, and from the qualitative interviews and discussions, it
appears that women have a significant role in fish cultivation activities except in harvesting and pond
preparation. 41 percent women are engaged in input purchase activity to a medium extent. Women
are mostly engaged in fish feeding. Regarding decision making, the involvement of women was quite
limited with only 24 percent of the women respondents reporting that they can express opinion and
sometimes influence decisions in fish culture activities. Only 13 percent reported they were able to
make decisions regarding the income from aquaculture.

With respect to environmental impacts, it was found that most of the farmers try to keep their pond
area clean. Most farmers use aluminum containers or plastic drums instead of polybags to transport
the fish seed. Those who transport using polybags reuse the polybags for other purposes, and most
farmers use the feed bags or sacks to store goods on the farm or household and to protect pond dykes
from erosion. Some farmers grow vegetables on the pond dykes, and among them a limited number
of them use pesticides or insecticide (mainly the case when the vegetable is the main crop). For
farmers where the fish is the major crop, insecticide and pesticide in vegetable cultivation on dykes is
not used since this would affect water quality and harm the fish.

The research team makes a series of recommendations, among which the main ones are:

- Interventions to bring about changes in farmers’ knowledge, behavior and practice levels
- Facilitate interaction between market actors including feed companies, feed dealers and retailers,
seed hatcheries and nurseries with the farmers so that farmers’ have better accessibility to
information and quality feed
- Support MFIs/NGOs to provide special (seasonal) “Feed Loan” where farmers will purchase feeds
from input dealers with the vouchers distributed by NGO/MFI and dealers can be paid in due time
- Live fish marketing facilities need to be popularized for better prices.
- Support the establishment of divisional/regional level feed mill associations to address malpractice
at feed production and sales level by i] installing lab facilities in Jashore and Khulna regions and ii]
lobbying with the government to reduce import taxes and ease administrative procedures around raw
material import.



                                                                                                             vii

- Motivate feed companies to invest more to reach poor markets to increase their market
competitiveness and also to invest more in promotional tools like farmer demonstration plots and
increase number of Technical/Extension officers to improve farmer level extension services
- Expand genetically improved brood bank for Carp and Tilapia in collaboration with other agencies
will improve the quality of hatchery produced fish seed.
- Promote the use of local high-quality Carp Pituitary Gland (CPG) sources
- Promote mechanized equipment to reduce operational cost and improve seed quality of hatcheries
- Seek ways to improve the current transport system to ensure brood, seed, and harvested fish quality
is maintained and mortality is low.

CPL also recommends two attribution methods as part of the intervention analyses to be carried by
BANA MEL. These methods will help to identify the causal link between observed (or expected to be
observed) changes and a specific intervention. It represents the extent to which observed
development effects can be attributed to a specific intervention or to the performance of one or more
partner taking account of other interventions, (anticipated or unanticipated) confounding factors, or
external shocks. In simple terms, attribution refers to the amount of change that is due to a particular
intervention out of the total change that takes place.

                          1

1.1 Background
Feed the Future - Bangladesh Aquaculture and Nutrition Activity, also referred as BANA, is a five-year
award made by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to WorldFish in February
2018. This is under the United States Government’s global hunger and food security initiative, Feed
the Future, and has the goal of achieving inclusive aquaculture sector growth through a market
systems approach in the Zone of Influence (ZOI) and Zone of Resilience (ZOR). BANA also builds on the
achievements of the six-year Aquaculture for Income and Nutrition (AIN) project, which ended in
2017, but applies a market system, rather than a direct delivery approach. This means stimulating co-
investment by the private sector and organizations to achieve the objectives with a focus on
sustainability from the start.

                                     Figure 1.1: Project Objectives

BANA’s market systems approach, places emphasis on facilitation rather than direct implementation,
and attempts to sustain positive aquaculture sector growth in southwest Bangladesh, Cox’s Bazar, and
Bandarban districts through the inclusive market system approach. A key principle of the Activity is to
encourage capacity building among existing value chain actors rather than delivering capacity building
to the actors that will not sustain at the end of the Activity. This market systems approach builds on
achievements from the AIN project for small-scale fish farmers who experienced livelihood
improvements through increased production and quality of Tilapia, carp, shrimp and prawn in the ZOI.

Using the market systems approach, and building on the success of the AIN project, BANA objectives
are: 1) Increased productivity of aquaculture production systems; 2) Strengthened aquaculture market
systems, with particular attention to expanding opportunities for women and youth; and 3) Increased
awareness and adoption of nutrition-related behavior, with a particular focus on women and youth.




                                                                                                          2

This report presents the baseline figures for
seven indicators along with other qualitative
information outlined in the BANA Monitoring,
Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) plan. The
baseline value will guide BANA to measure its
achievements and outputs over the period of
implementation. This will also help to devise
appropriate monitoring tools for to track the
Activity’s interventions. WorldFish assigned
Consiglieri Private Limited (CPL) to conduct
the baseline study based on the seven
indicators leading to the intended results of
the activity and current aquaculture situation
in ZOI and ZOR.

The main objective of this study was to collect
and analyze the existing situation of
aquaculture sector of ZOI and ZOR in line with
the set of indicators given in the table below.           Figure 1.2: Feed the Future ZOI and ZOR
BANA has identified indicators (both standard
and custom) along with targets in its Program Description (PD) and MEL plan.

The baseline study focused mainly on five quantitative indicators of Intermediate Result (IR) – IR1
which is: Increased aquaculture productivity and another two quantitative indicators related to IR2 –
Strengthened aquaculture value chains. In addition, the study team also addressed four qualitative
questions outlined in the BANA PD which are:

      a)    What are the underlying causes of poor market functioning?
      b)    Why is there lack of trust between market actors, how can this be improved?
      c)    What are the reasons of lack of information on market signals, how this can be solved?
      d)    What are the reasons of limits on market access placed by actors with preferential
            arrangements with market gatekeepers?

                        5

2.1 Research instruments
The study team took holistic approach and applied mixed-methods design with a combination of
qualitative and quantitative data collection methodologies. The qualitative component consisted of a
desk review, Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with program
stakeholders and participants. The quantitative component consisted of a semi-structured
questionnaire with stakeholders with in-depth data collection. Each method is described in more
detail below.

2.1.1 Desk research

Prior to field research, the team conducted a methodical review of the secondary documents
(including PD, Theory of Change (ToC), Result Framework (RF) and indicator table, AIN end-line report,
and database to have a better understanding of planned BANA interventions (what, how, why) and
the modality of work of the Activity. The study team also reviewed existing national secondary
documents of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), Fisheries Statistical Yearbook/National Fish Week
Journal by Department of Fisheries (DoF) related to the BANA indicators.

2.1.2 Key Informant Interview

The team also conducted 45 In-Depth Interviews (IDI) with the fish farms. The team used purposive
sampling for the market and regulatory level actors. Through the KIIs the study team strived to
understand the linkages among the Value Chain (VC) actors, motivation in their role and challenges
faced by them. A checklist was used to collect the information from market actors which was updated
during the field if the team found any new area for exploration. For the KIIs, districts were selected
according to the market actor propensity suggested by the Fisheries expert in the research team and
also from the previous experience of WorldFish in Feed the Future zone and fishery sector. BANA is
working in the Feed the Future zone in collaboration with other companies and WorldFish’s AIN
project’s previous work with some Local Service Providers (LSPs). Based on the collective experience
of CPL and WorldFish BANA team, the samples were distributed with respect to the representative
areas.

2.1.3 Focus Group Discussion

Along the quantitative survey, the research team conducted FGDs with fish farming HH members.
FGDs were distributed across target districts, men, women and youth groups. The gender and youth
issues were identified and probed through these FGDs in addition to the questionnaire survey. Each
FGD had 7 to 11 participants and the research team focused and discussed about the knowledge and
practice of fish farmers regarding fish culture as well as the problems and constraints regarding market
linkages based on a checklist of key questions.



                                                                                                           6

2.1.4       Semi-structured questionnaire

The team also sampled market and regulatory-level actors using semi-structured questionnaires. The
semi-structured questionnaires strived to collect information from firms and market actors and the
KIIs were selected according to the market actor propensity. As in the case of sample area and
respondent selection, the research team consulted with BANA team to identify best representative
areas and actors.

2.2 Triangulation method

The research conducted a HH survey of the fish farmers (carp and Tilapia) with the help of experienced
enumerators who have solid understanding as to the sector. The data collected from the HH survey
was triangulated with the information obtained from the KIIs, IDIs and FGDs and well as checked
against BBS data and AIN end-line data.

2.3 Sampling
The target population was selected from the Feed the Future ZOI which included 5 districts in Dhaka,
10 districts in Khulna, and 6 districts in Barisal division. Also, the ZOR districts, Cox’s Bazar and
Bandarban were included from Chattogram division. With respect to the respondent category, the
primary respondent group were the farmers or farming HHs producing Tilapia and carp including
women and youth in their ponds. At market level, there were six major types of market actors-
hatcheries, nurseries, inputs/feed manufacturers, dealers/sub-dealers and retailers, fish traders and
possible buyers. Regulatory level actors included government officials of Department of Fisheries
(DoF) and Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI).

The sampling procedure involved multistage cluster sampling with proportional allocation for
selection of Tilapia and carp fish farmers and stratified sampling with purposive allocation for selection
of input and output actors.

**The total number of surveyed samples was 2,013.

2.3.1 Revised sampling

While the cleaning the dataset, some of the samples were found to be large scale fish farmers. To
avoid the data bias, 37 samples (i.e. farmers who had land area more than 5 hectares) were excluded
from the dataset since BANA intends to support the small scale fish farmers mainly (with less than 5
hectare). While validating the analyzed result with comparable reference data like results of AIN
impact study, it was found that the average pond size comparatively high. To triangulate the data, the
research team had compared the data with AIN end-line study with the help of the statistician. It was
found that around 97 percent of the AIN samples’ average pond size was less than 100 decimals, where
in the baseline study it was only 64 percent. Also, more than 13 percent of the sampled farmers had
average land size more than 300 decimals; for AIN this figure was less than one percent.

Also, from the outlier calculation using normal Q-Q plot it was found that, the some of the data points
were not normally distributed and the standard deviation was very high (274.15). Through the outlier
analysis the outranged samples were selected for elimination from the dataset. Based on the outlier
analysis and data triangulation around 13 percent of the sample (244 samples) were eliminated from
the dataset having more than 255 decimals of pond area. The distribution of these samples was also
found scattered in the normal Q-Q plot. After excluding the outlier samples, it was found that, the
remaining samples were normally distributed and did not have any impact on the sampling frame, and
the standard deviation was found to be 56.25. Excluding total 284 outlier samples, final sample size
was 1,729. As the eliminated samples were outlier and scattered, it did not have any impact on the
sampling frame. The sample distribution is tabled below.

2.3.2 Household level (Fish Farmers)

Here, the total target population (fish farmers) is divided into two types of fish farmers - carp and
Tilapia farmers. For sample size calculation, Cochran’s method of simple random sampling was used
which is widely followed for development research. The equation (Fig 2.1) was used to determine the
sample size and. With 2 percent precision level and 95 percent confidence level, the total sample
calculated was 2015 for carp and Tilapia farmers previously. With the precision level of 2.22 percent,
the calculated sample size is 1,723. The sample distribution was carried out according to
administrative units of District, Upazila and Union.

In the 1st stage of sample distribution, the proportion of carp and Tilapia farmers was calculated as
0.67 and 0.33, based on the respective production volume as found in the Fisheries Statistical
Yearbook 2016-17. 1

The 2nd stage of sample distribution was based on districts. The presence of large number of farmers
in a district does not necessarily mean a large amount of fish production and higher concentration of
market actors. Instead fish production is reportedly high is where there is a likelihood of most types
of market actors. The study team therefore calculated district-wise sample proportionate to fish
production (high, medium and low) statistics (FRSS 2016-17). In case of carp production, 13 districts
were selected from high, medium and low categories, which belong to the ZOI. In case of Tilapia


                                                                                                                     9

production, all the districts (7 districts) were selected from high and medium categories in ZOI. As
suggested by the BANA team, the study team took samples from Cox's Bazar and Bandarban for carp
and Tilapia as they are in ZOR. Thus, the total selected districts were 15 for carp farmers and 9 for
Tilapia farmers. In total, there were 16 sample districts.

In the 3rd stage of sample distribution, a total of 30 upazilas were selected based on carp farmer
concentration, i.e. two upazilas per district. And from each upazila, one union meaning a total of 30
unions were selected for data collection. This was the Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) for the carp fish
farmer survey.

Similarly, 18 unions, one from each of the 18 upazilas from the nine districts identified with high
concentration of Tilapia farmers were selected as PSU for the Tilapia fish farmer survey. Since
adequate sample could not be found in some of the selected unions, the data collection team collected
sample from adjacent unions. With consideration to overlap, data was collected from 143 unions of
38 upazilas in total.

The field team collected data from 2,013 respondents. The data cleaning process left out 284 samples
as outliers. After data cleaning, the total sample was 1,729.

2.3.3 Market & regulatory level actors

The team sampled market and regulatory-level actors using semi-structured questionnaires and KII
tools. The semi-structured questionnaires aimed to collect information from firms and market actors
and the KIIs were conducted according to the market actor propensity in an area. As previously
mentioned, this was selected in consultation with the BANA team based on their previous working

2 Agents are the market actors who work as intermediaries in between fish wholesalers (mostly of regional hubs         10
or big cities) and local fish traders (locally called as arotders) and help them trade bulk amount of fish.

2.4 Quality control mechanisms
Quality control involved careful selection of Data Enumerators (DEs), intensive training for the data
enumerators and supervisors, field test of data collection tools, back-checking, spot checking,
reviewing accomplishments with targets, and ensuring data quality through regular checking, and data
processing.

For data collection, DEs were recruited based on whether they had at least 5 years of experience in
tab-based field data collection, especially in fisheries subsector and relevant academic background.

CPL provided a 7-day long training together with field testing for the survey team to ensure quality
data collection and efficiency of the process. The training included sessions on the aquaculture section
and objective of the research, understanding the questionnaire, usage of tab in data collection and
data syncing in server, data validation and quality control during interviews, and critical issues and
challenges during data collection and how to overcome these.

To measure the effectiveness of data collection tools, when extracting the desired and accurate data
using tabs, CPL conducted a field test. The study team checked whether the questions given in the
tools were appropriate, represented the content as comprehensively possible to collect all the
information needed and further modified the tools based on the result of field testing.

For back-checking, 5 percent of the HHs surveyed were re-interviewed. The deployed data collection
team also reviewed their progress against given targets for each field day during the course of this
study. CPL set targets for the number of samples to be interviewed by DEs for each day and this was
4 samples per day per enumerator. At the end of each field day, Survey Coordinators (SCs) and
Associate Data Analyst (ADA) checked to determine if their targets were accomplished and took
necessary actions for planning the next field day. DEs shared their data, identified any specific
concerns, and shared field for the next day. The field team then submitted a daily update to the BANA
MEL team.

To ensure data quality, the Junior Fisheries Expert (JFE) checked the stored data in the data cloud each
day after data collection. The research team ensured data consistency and when missing areas of data
were identified, these were relayed to the survey team to take steps make up the gap. After
confirmation from the JFE, the Open Data Kits (ODK) expert updated the database.

All data enumerators were trained on the use of ODK based data collection tool. Data processing
comprised of editing and data cleaning, generation of analytical tables, and matching of data. CPL
followed inductive coding, categorization, and relationship among categories, corroboration and
validation with other data.

2.5 Methodology limitations

2.5.1 Religious observances

The team collected data in May 2019, during the month of Ramadan. As a result, respondents were
not interested in giving time for data collection because of fasting and preparation for their break of
fast.


                                                                                                           11

The season of data collection was in middle of summer in Bangladesh when the heat was at its apex.
Therefore, data collectors faced health constraints in their movements.

2.5.2 Recall bias

The data collection period was in May 2019, when all the quantitative data was collected
retrospectively where the participants were asked to recall their status back from the situation in
2018. The respondents were asked about their fish culture information, income and other quantitative
information. Regarding recall data, issues like data accuracy and reliability are sometimes
compromised.

Respondents were also unable to identify their problems related to feed and seed quality and
production practices because of their lack of knowledge about Best Management Practices (BMP) and
technologies.

To minimize this recall bias, the team devised detailed and explanatory questionnaire and question
guide. In the training session, data enumerators were properly trained on recall basis data collection
methods and techniques. During data collection, respondents were also allowed sufficient time for
recalling 2018 data. Also, the enumerators were instructed to overcome the recall bias by anchoring
respondents’ memory in specific events as they happened, rather than just asking them to recall their
memory.

2.5.3 Rice cultivation

The data collection period also overlapped with rice cultivation season. Since many fish farmers are
also involved in rice cultivation, many respondents were engaged in their rice paddies and it was
difficult for the enumerators to find convenient time for the interviews.

2.5.4 Topography

Since households in Bandarban are situated in the hilly terrain, it took significant travel time to go
from one HH to another. Therefore, in some cases, the enumerators faced difficulties in transportation
in these hilly areas.

The study team also addressed the four qualitative questions below outlined in the BANA PD.

WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF POOR MARKET FUNCTIONING ?

Lack of good quality inputs, mostly seed, is the major reason for the inefficient functioning of the fish
market. It is evident that the farmers have limited knowledge of identifying good quality seed. In most
of the cases, they do not even know that better quality seed is available other than what they use. In
addition, there is a lack of knowledge of production practices and pond preparation which leads to
the poor fish population. The female farmers and adult female household members are not well-
informed about seed and feed quality and efficient usage of these inputs. Also, they have few market
linkages with the other actors in the market. However, in a similar situation, the younger farmers (15
to 29 years) have comparatively better access to technical knowledge and market linkages.

The lack of demand of quality seed and feed from farmers along with low affordability leads to the
supply side (hatchery and nursery) to make a profit out of low-quality seed. In addition, there are mal-
practices (like mixing low quality products) and lack of knowledge of production practices in the seed
and feed market. Input producers produce low-quality seed and feed and push these into the market
through fry hawkers and dealers. Also, farmers are discouraged in using good commercial feed
because of high cost and in case of seed, the quality degrades in transportation from the producers to
the final customers. These brings about loss of interest and trust about the brand or the producer by
the farmers. Reduced quality during the transportation is a major issue in the forward linkages (output
market of fish).

WHY IS THERE LACK OF TRUST BETWEEN MARKET ACTORS, HOW CAN THIS BE IMPROVED?

There are various malpractices in the market among actors. In the feed market, the producers do not
always ensure good quality product. They change the ratio of the raw materials because of the low
supply which degrades the quality of the feed. Also, there are local feed mills which make low quality
feeds while packaging with the name of branded products. These kind of practices damages the trust
of the customers (farmers) even about the good quality feed brands. Strong monitoring of the feed
mills and markets may reduce this problem to some extent.

In the case of the seed market, sometimes hatcheries and nurseries mix low quality or different species
of fish seed because farmers cannot identify them. Small farmers are the main victim of these
practices. As customers, the small farmers are not considered important by the seed producers or
sellers since they buy in small quantity. Also, the hatcheries and nurseries are not available in all
production level areas. Being located far off from their customers is an opportunity for the hatcheries
and nurseries, especially for the intermediary seed suppliers or traders (seed agents and patilwala) to
sell substandard fry and fingerlings to these small farmers since they are not likely to meet this
customer again. Also, a major portion of the farmers (and almost all the women farmers) buy
fingerlings from fry hawkers who do not ensure quality of seeds. Bulk or group purchasing behavior of
fingerlings through farmers association may ensure good quality seed supply from hatcheries and
nurseries. Farmers group or association can select (or even partner with) quality seed suppliers and
establish long term business relationship with them.

WHAT ARE THE REASONS OF LACK OF INFORMATION ON MARKET SIGNALS , HOW CAN THIS BE SOLVED?



                                                                                                            17

In general, the farmers and firms forecast the market demand and price based on the previous year,
but the demand and price fluctuate due to many reasons like oversupply in the market, natural
disasters, political unrest, government policy, etc. The firms and farmers lack access to updated
information on the overall market changes and behavior of other actors. It is essential to make them
aware of the updated market demand and price for fishes. Mass communication, farmer’s
cooperatives, and ICT based communication can support this cause to a great extent.

WHAT ARE THE REASONS OF LIMITS ON MARKET ACCESS PLACED BY ACTORS WITH PREFERENTIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH
MARKET GATEKEEPERS?


Limited market access placed by the market actors with privileged arrangements is a form of
syndicate3, which is very common in Bangladesh. Producer level syndicate in the market of feed, seed,
and fish exploit the fish producers (farmers) maximizing their own profit. Feed companies control the
feed supply to manipulate the price in the peak season, which reduces the accessibility of the farmers
on the feed. Also, the manufacturers promote the feeds stating the raw material ratios on the label of
packaging which they do not always honestly ensure. In the case of medicine and chemical import and
manufacture, there is a conflict between the Department of Livestock (DLS) and the DoF about the
authority to sanction the permits. This conflict causes a lack of access to the raw materials of the feed
and medicine producers.

4.1 Descriptions of respondents
This chapter presents the demographic characteristics of the respondents in 2018.

In Bangladesh, the percentage of male and female are 50.1 percent and 49.9 percent respectively of
the total national population of 162.7 4. This is quite similar to what was found in this study i.e. 52
percent were male and 48 percent were female HH members. According to this study, the average HH
size is 5. With respect to profession in fish farming, 96 percent were male and only 4 percent were
female fish farmers from among the study respondents. This gendered percentage is about the same
for both carp and Tilapia farmers. The proportion of female farmers is higher in carp than Tilapia
culture. The men are the main decision makers in case of fish farming at the HH level thus the
overwhelming proportion of men and very little engagement of women in fish farming.



4 BBS, 2019, Gender Statistics of Bangladesh 2018, Statistics and Informatics Division (SID), Bangladesh Bureau   20
of Statistics (BBS), Ministry of Planning, Government of The People’s Republic of Bangladesh

According to age categories, the population percentages for age 0-14 years, 15-29 years, 30-59 years
and more than 60 years are 25 percent, 28 percent, 36 percent and 11 percent respectively which is
not very different from that of the national data. According to the national data, in the rural areas, the
population percentage for age 0-14 years, 15-29 years, 30-59 years and more than 60 years are 30
percent, 27 percent, 34 percent and 9 percent respectively. Among the fish farmer respondents, 85
percent are above 30 years of age and 15 percent are between 15 to 29 years old. The ratio is similar
for both carp and Tilapia farmers.




                             Table 4.1: Household Land Size for Carp and Tilapia Farmers



The average number and size of land for fish farmer HHs is disaggregated by pond/gher5, cultivable
land, homestead land, courtyard and fruit and timber garden the survey findings (Table 4.1). The table
shows that the average size of cultivable land per HH is higher for the Tilapia farmers than that of carp
farmers. Carp farmers cultured 74-decimal6 ponds/ghers per HH where Tilapia farmers cultured 130
decimals per HH on an average. Tilapia farmers were mostly commercial farmers and therefore had
more cultivable land and larger ponds overall and also leased more ponds. A majority of the carp
farmers were traditional farmers using mainly the household pond and leased more cultivable land
than the Tilapia farmers, while the carp farmers leased more land for crop cultivation than fish culture.

The average size of ponds cultured by female farmers is 38 decimals, much less than the average pond
size cultured by male farmers which is 103 decimals. The difference between male and female farmers
with respect to leased in and leased out pond sizes is also significant. On average, the female farmers




5 A gher is a pond dug into a rice field to use for fish farming, with the dugout soil used to create dykes around   21
the pond
6 1 Hectare= 247 Decimal

leased in 5 decimal ponds and male
farmers leased in 40 decimal ponds. This is
in accordance with the Bangladesh
situation where men take lead in almost all
income generating activities in Bangladesh,
controlling the land ownership and land
uses in a household. Also, that the survey
found the female farmers were mostly
traditional and marginal farmers, not
commercial farmers. All the farmers with
larger pond size were male farmers.

The study disaggregated the average pond
size by carp and Tilapia farmers in ZOI and
ZOR.

In ZOI, the farmers are experienced in fish
culture activities which is comparatively
new for farmers in the ZOR. Which is why,
the average cultivated pond area per HH is
lower in the ZOR than that of ZOI for both
carp and Tilapia farmers.

From the AIN end-line study in 2017 (in
ZOI), it was found that the number of
ponds per HH of carp farmers was 1.5
which was same as found in this baseline
survey. In case of Tilapia farmers, average
number of ponds per HH was 2.2 which was
higher, 2.9 in the AIN end-line study7. The
average pond size for carp farmers was 79
decimals per HH which was 52 decimals in
AIN study. In case of Tilapia farmers, the
average pond size was 183 decimals per HH
which was 200 decimals two years earlier
in the AIN study. The size of selected pond
was 45 decimals per HH for carp farmers
while it was 63 decimals in case of Tilapia
farmers. In this regard, the AIN study found
that the size of selected pond was 29.61
decimal per HH for carp farmers and 83.22
decimal for Tilapia farmers. Overall there
seems to be a fall in number and size of

4.2 Stocking

4.2.1 Type of fish species stocked by farmers

This study considered 13 different species of carp along with Tilapia which are commonly cultured in
the study area. Prawn is also cultured popularly in these areas. Mostly, the carp and Tilapia farmers
culture prawn mixed with carp and Tilapia for extra profit margin. For stocking purposes, the most
preferred fish species are carps (Rui, Catla, Mrigal, Silver carp, Grass carp) and Tilapia among the
respondent farmers.




                                Figure 4.3: Stocking of Carp and Tilapia Farmers


                                                                                                        23

The survey found that 46 percent carp farmers stocked Tilapia along with carp and of the Tilapia
farmers, 82 percent stocked Rui (carp). The stocking of other carp fishes (Catla, Mrigal, Silver carp)
along with Tilapia were also significantly high in 2018. It is evident that over 72 percent farmers (both
carp and Tilapia) selected fish species based on pond condition, culture system and profit margin from
the market value of the fish. The research team found that farmers also considered the feeding habit
of fishes at different levels of the pond water by different species because the farmers mostly practice
mixed fish culture system instead of stocking single fish species. For example, Rui is column feeder
and Catla, Bighead, silver carp are surface feeders. On the other hand, Tilapia takes food from all levels
of the pond, and is easily cultured with carps. There is less feeding conflict among the species if species
are stocked with consideration given to the feeding habit of the species. Another factor considered in
selecting the fish species was disease resilience. Ghonia and Mola are not stocked by the farmers since
they practice typically semi-intensive fish culture and these small fish species cannot survive in mixed
culture system along with larger fishes.

The figure also shows the stocking density of carp and Tilapia practices by farmer. On an average, the
farmers were found to stock 40 carp fishes per decimal which weighs around 2 kg, costing BDT 287.
Similarly, farmers stocked 145 pieces of Tilapia fry per decimal in 2018, the cost for which was BDT
165. The stocking density of the carp and Tilapia is almost similar to the findings of AIN study in 2017
where the farmers were found to stock 30 pieces of carp per decimal and 137 pieces of Tilapia per
decimal.

4.2.2 Stocking related practices

The stocking practice of the farmers interviewed was found to be diverse depending on their
knowledge and access to information and also differed based on water availability and intensification
of culture system.

A necessary step when releasing fish fry/fingerlings into the pond is acclimatization so that the fry or
fingerlings can adapt first to the water to be later released in. 51 percent of the surveyed Tilapia
farmers practiced acclimatization8 of the fry before stocking. Similarly, 43 percent of carp farmer
practiced and so about half of the carp and Tilapia farmers surveyed were found to have knowledge
of acclimatization. From the field interviews (with both farmers and nurseries), it was found that the
knowledge of acclimatization is disseminated by nursery to the farmers. The nurseries inform the
farmers about acclimatization procedure to ensure the fingerlings provided by them have a good
survival rate. Hawkers also give some of this same information support.

86 and 85 percent of carp and Tilapia farmers (respectively) reported that they calculated amount of
stocking density based on water area in decimal. From the IDIs and FGDs, it was found that farmers
calculate stocking per decimal of water area differently in different regions. In most of the cases, they
did not practice any standard pattern of fish stocking with respect to pond size since they did not have
knowledge. Also, they were found to stock excess amount of fish than optimum in a pond.

In case of last year’s stocking of seed, most of the carp and Tilapia farmers did not check quality of
fingerlings and fry and less than half of the carp and Tilapia farmers knew about checking health of
fish. Generally, the farmers mostly checked the size and weight of fish to determine the amount of

feed required and some farmers simultaneously checked during calculating ratio. The research team
found a serious shortage of knowledge sharing about the stocking practices and from the interviews
with hatcheries and nurseries, it was reported that because of inefficient stocking practices the
farmers get less than optimum fish production.

                                                                                                     25

4.3 Production

4.3.1 Fixed costs

Fixed cost areas include cost of equipment, infrastructure and long durable materials and in 2018
these were practices where most investment was required by both carp and Tilapia farmers.

From the analysis and qualitative study, the research team found that the 72 percent of carp and 70
percent of Tilapia farmers mostly invested in fishing net to catch fish and marketing containers for
transporting the fish.

To maintain the water quality and pond, 39 percent carp and 50 percent Tilapia farmers invested in
dewatering and drying equipment for drying out their ponds after every cycle of production. Farmers
set nets as fences around the ponds to prevent fish escape during flooding and restrict the access of
predator fish and other animals. Small-holder farmers invest less in construction of a farm shed or
guard house for security purposes as this is requires high investment including labor and maintenance
cost. Also ponds nearby HH does not require farm shed or guard house for security purposes.

In 2018, the average fixed cost per hectare was BDT 11,484 for the carp farmers and for the Tilapia
farmers it was BDT 12,782; these are a little less than the AIN survey values of average fixed cost per
hectare for the carp (BDT 11,500) and Tilapia (BDT 18,797) farmers.

The difference between the baseline and AIN survey value is because the AIN supported farmers had
better knowledge and therefore made higher investment for maximum production.




                                                                                                          26
                                            Figure 4.5 Fixed Cost

The investment cost of the Tilapia farmers was higher compared to carp farmers in 2018 as most of
the Tilapia culture was commercial. Since the Tilapia farmers dry the pond after every cycle of
production, the dewatering and drying equipment cost was higher than that of carp farmers in 2018.

4.3.2 Input costs

Input costs include commercial feed, farm/homemade feed, feed ingredients, organic fertilizer,
chemical fertilizer, minerals, lime, medicine, chemicals and other inputs.

It was found that, 75 percent of the Tilapia farmers and 57 percent of the carp farmers use commercial
feed. In some cases, the commercial feed is more used by the Tilapia farmers (BDT 4,930/ha) than
carp farmers (BDT 1418/ha); in case of supplementary feed, about the same percentage of carp
farmers (72 percent) and Tilapia farmers (73 percent) also use supplementary feed like oil cake, bran,
corn etc.

From the qualitative study, it was found that carp and Tilapia farmers used different practices in
feeding application. They used both homemade and supplementary feeds in initial stages of fish
culture and later they fed commercial feed before harvesting to ensure better production volume. The
Tilapia farmers apply this practice more than the carp farmer. Some farmers depend only on
homemade feed and raw supplementary feed to minimize the production cost. Another reason for
using homemade feed was that they were not sure about the quality of the commercial feed.

Tilapia and carp farmers also use fertilizers to maintain and ensure good pond water quality. In 2018,
it was found that most of the farmers – 63 percent of carp farmers and 64 percent of Tilapia farmers.




                                          Figure 4.6 Input Costs
                                                                                                         27

The use of organic fertilizer is comparatively low, found to be used only by 22 percent carp farmers
and 18 percent Tilapia farmers.

Most of the farmers were not interested in the use of raw cow dung and poultry litter as these can
create health hazard and deteriorate pond water quality. However, in the ZOR zone, both carp and
Tilapia farmers still use raw cow dung and poultry litter to maintain water productivity without giving
consideration to water quality which is an indication of their lack of knowledge about water
management.

Generally, most carp and Tilapia farmers (77 percent and 80 percent respectively) used lime as
disinfectant agent to keep pond environment and water clean. Both carp and Tilapia farmers also use
some medicine for preventing diseases and improve dissolved oxygen in the water.

The yearly input cost per hectare is BDT 184,066 for carp farmers and BDT 400,775 for Tilapia farmers
respectively. For carp farmers, the baseline value is 58 percent higher than AIN (BDT 116,354) since
use of commercial feed has increased for carp fish along with increased price.

4.3.3 Production related practices

The qualitative study also found that both Tilapia and carp farmers use lime and fertilizer before
stocking the fish as a part of pond preparation. Most of the fish farmers (93 percent carp and 92
percent Tilapia farmers) seem to have a good understanding that fertilizers can be used to grow
natural food or to keep the water color green because it is good for fish culture.

The research team found that both Tilapia and carps farmers have diversified knowledge on feed use
which varies with geographic location. The frequency of feeding varies seasonally. In winter the body
metabolism of fish is slower and feed demand is thus low, and accordingly the fish farmer provides
less feed in winter.

It is hard for the smallholder fish farmers to provide feed on regular basis; since the price of feed is
high and requires continuous financial flow. However, it was found that smallholder fish farmers who
cultivate commercially try to provide feed on regular basis to ensure better production.




                                                                                                           28
                                      Figure 4.7: Feed related Practices

                                     Figure 4.8 Production related Practices



Carp and Tilapia farmers use both pellet and non-pellet feeds in fish farming. From the survey it was
found that, 12 percent of carp and 24 percent of Tilapia farmers use pellet feed to avoid wastage of
feed.

Farmers with limited knowledge used non-pellet feeds to minimize the feeding cost. More than 50
percent of the farmers (53 percent carp and 56 percent Tilapia farmers) use pellet feeds (commercial
or locally made). Occasionally they also use other feeds like oil cake, corn, rice bran etc. directly in raw
form to get desired production and minimize the feed cost. Most farmers, i.e. 77 percent carp and 85
percent Tilapia farmers, agreed that feed should be provided based on the body weight of the fish and
stocking density.

From the qualitative study it was found that, farmer knew about the procedure of calculating feed
amount based on random sampling the fish and measuring body weight, but they were reluctant to
practice as it means additional cost when they hire labor for netting. Most of the time, farmers
calculate the feed amount to be applied by sampling a few fish while others calculate the feed based
on what they can afford.

Among farmers surveyed, only 39 percent of the farmers were found to be concerned with water
quality of the pond, and rest 61 percent had limited knowledge about water management. They
mainly checked the turbidity and water color. 87 percent carp and 86 percent Tilapia farmers were
found to be concerned about the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Some farmers also
considered the water pH and presence of toxic gas in the water.




                                                                                                               29

Based on the water quality, and maintenance of a high-quality pond environment, –it was found that
48 percent carp and 51 percent Tilapia farmers- pumped in or exchanged water in the pond. As a
source of water, most farmers, 90 percent carp and 96 percent Tilapia, use natural surface water
sources like canal or stream or underground water using mechanized pumps.

During pumping in or exchanging water in the pond, 34 percent of the both Tilapia and carp farmers
used net as a protection to filter the water.

4.3.4 Feed Conversion Ratios

Since the farmers practice mixed feeding with
different feeds, it was difficult to calculate
individual FCR of any single feed. From the
surveyed data it was found that a total 1.43 kg
feed was provided to produce 1 kg amount of
fish. From the qualitative study it was found that,
commercial famers provide feed on a regular
basis and maintain the harvesting cycle. Farmers
who cultivate HH purpose do not provide
sufficient feed, in that case fish have to depend
natural feed for growing in the pond. Most of the
farmers who cultivated fish for HH purposes did
not provide adequate amount of feed and also                        Figure 4.9 Feed Conversion Ratios
did not maintain the harvesting cycle. So, it was
not possible to ascertain the FCR.




                                                                                                        30

4.4 Harvesting

4.4.1 Harvesting related practices

Carp and Tilapia farmers produce fish for HH consumption, gift and commercial business. Though carp
and Tilapia have different production cycle periods, 42 percent carp and 53 percent Tilapia –farmers
harvest more than three times or more (multiple) in a year, few farmers harvest one to three times in
a year.

Most farmers depend on credit or loan to source inputs and because of the financial pressure to repay
loan or credit, farmers harvest multiple times. During harvest the larger sized fish were selected for
sale and the small fishes kept for further growing. After every harvest the farmers repay their loans
and credits.

In the multiple harvesting system, the final harvest is done at the end of production cycle and was
considered as this system is known as seasonal harvest. 62 percent carp and 68 percent Tilapia farmers
completed the seasonal harvest using their own labor.

While harvesting and selling fish, farmers also keep some for HH consumption and as gift for friends,
neighbors and relatives. In 2018, the average fish consumption per HH was 130 kg. From total harvest,
Tilapia farmers sold 93 percent and 7 percent was kept for own consumption and gift. Carp farmers
kept 16 percent for consumption and gift and sold 84 percent. As Tilapia is cultured mostly for
commercial purpose, the rate of own consumption and providing gift is low compared to that of carp.

                                                                                                         31

4.4.2 Yield

The study has found that the average annual yield per
hectare for carp farmer was 2,475 kg/ha and for Tilapia
farmers it was 3,770 kg/ha. In the AIN survey, the average
yield per hectare for fish seed supported carp farmer was
lower 2,523 kg/ha and in case of Tilapia farmers, the value
was 3,171 kg for control Tilapia farmers and much higher
Tilapia seed supported farmers at 6,438 kg/ha.

This baseline study found that carp and Tilapia farmers
who cultured commercially had yield of 2,547 kg/ha and
3,895 kg/ha respectively in 2018. The total yield of the carp
and Tilapia farmers who produced for HH consumption
was 1,517 kg and 1,527 kg per hectare respectively in 2018.

Commercial farmers used higher quality inputs and
improved technology and practice and, as a result, they
had a higher yield. The average yield for carp and Tilapia
HHs was 748 kg/HH and 2,394 kg/HH respectively last year.
In the AIN survey, the average yield per HH for fish seed
supported was 418 kg/HH for carp and 1,983 kg/HH for
seed supported Tilapia farmers.

From the gender perspective, it was found that female
farmers mostly culture fish only for HH consumption, so
the yield was comparatively low (carp female farmers got
1,298 kg per hectare and Tilapia female farmer 2,440 kg
per hectare). On the other hand, male farmers were
involved intensively and had more experience than female
farmers and, as a result, the yield was higher for male
farmers, carp male farmers got 2,508 kg/ha and Tilapia
male farmer got 3,784 kg/ha.

The study also found that youth fish farmers growing
Tilapia had a higher yield (4,510 kg per hectare) than the
older farmers (over 30) up to 3,612 kg/ha. The younger
farmers had less experience but they adopted improved
technology for fish culture and took risks to get better
yield.

4.4.3 Sales

The survey estimated the total volume of yearly sales per HH based on the gender and age. From the
gender perspective it was found that the volume of yearly sales was higher for male fish farmers (649
kg/HH for carp and 2,252 kg/HH for Tilapia farmers). The value was very low for the female farmers,
only 157 kg/HH for carp and 185/HH for Tilapia.

The qualitative interviews under this study found that female farmers are not engaged in commercial
farming, mainly culturing for homestead purpose. On the other hand, the Tilapia male farmers mostly
culture commercially, also the production achieved by the commercial Tilapia male farmers was higher
than the carp male farmers.

The younger fish farmers culture Tilapia commercially and have adopted improved technology, as a
result the sales was higher for the younger Tilapia farmers, getting up to 2,360 kg/HH and therefore
also got better sales.

Based on the sales in 2018, the average price of carp and Tilapia fish was BDT 134/kg and BDT 102/kg
respectively. In the AIN survey, the average price of carp and Tilapia fish was BDT 137/kg and BDT
96/kg respectively. The price of the both fishes fluctuates based on the supply of the fish and market
demand in specific market locations. If the supply of fish is higher than the customer demand, the
price then falls. Also, the demand of white fish varies from region to region. The price of white fish is
comparatively low in ZOR since marine fish is more popular and in demand in this area. Also, the price
of Tilapia fish is comparatively low in market since most people have a perception that Tilapia fish are
not good for health because they think it is not cultured properly. This perception is gradually changing
and the demand of Tilapia fish is increasing again nowadays (further explained in the gender section).

4.5 Access to inputs and finance

4.5.1 Access to inputs

Major problems regarding seed or fingerling quality, purchase and feed sourcing were identified
through the survey. For both carp and Tilapia, around 41 percent farmers were found to be aware of
the quality variations of seed and feeds. Otherwise the rest (about 59 percent), farmers did not know
that higher quality of seed and feed was available other than what they used. It was therefore difficult
for these respondents to identify whether they faced problems in seed and feed quality and sourcing.

For both carp and Tilapia, the major problems were in unavailability of fish fry and fingerling, not
getting good-sized and uniform fry or fingerling and the high mortality rate of fish fingerlings. The fry
or fingerling are not able to survive stress during transportation from nursery to farm.

This is because during transportation, the amount of dissolved oxygen falls and there is also
fluctuation of temperature. A few farmers (from the KIIs) complained about the quality of the brood
fish while this was a major complaint from the nurseries.




                                Figure 4.13: Problems regarding Access to Inputs
                                                                                                            34

When purchasing good quality seed or fingerlings, farmers reported unavailability of good quality seed
as a major problem. The farmers report that fry hawkers were not available during the peak season of
fish stocking. Carp farmers identified this problem as being more severe than the Tilapia farmers. This
is because, Tilapia fry were sourced from the hatcheries directly as common practice. The research
team found a few cases where fry hawkers were also selling Tilapia fish fry to the farmers. High price
of fingerling is a problem which was defined as a limiting factor to getting a higher profit margin.

The difficulties of feed sourcing are mostly similar for both carp and Tilapia farmers. In both cases,
farmers reported unavailability of good quality feed. Tilapia farmers complained about the price of
feed more than the carp farmers. This is because the market price for Tilapia feed is much higher than
that of carp feed. In addition to the feed, there was unavailability of required feed ingredients in the
market. From the interviews with feed dealers and retailers, it was found that the feed companies
(mostly large) reduced the supply of fish feeds and raised the price in the peak season. This is a very
common form of market manipulation. As a result, the fish farmers faced financial problems because
of high feed price, forcing them to decrease the amount of feed purchase. Most farmers identified
lack of credit facility in both feed and seed sourcing.

4.5.2 Access to finance

In case of access to finance, the survey found that the farmers took loan from MFIs, bank, input sellers,
family and friends, agriculture loan, mohajon or local money lender, output arotder9, and
cooperatives. MFIs were the principal source of finance for both the carp and Tilapia farmers. 10% of
carp farmers and 12 percent of Tilapia farmers took loan from MFIs in 2018. 2-3% farmers took loan
from the banks. From the qualitative data collection, it was also found that farmers were more
comfortable with MFIs, cooperatives and informal sources of finance for borrowing money because
these sources did not require much paper work and it is possible to get within short period as they
desired. Mostly, farmers reported that they did not go to bank for loans because of the hassle of
paperwork and another requirement. Also, bribe has to be paid to get a loan within a short period of
time. Very few farmers took loans from cooperatives and output arotder.

Figure 4.13 shows the average loan amounts per farmer in 2018. Tilapia farmers took larger loans than
carp farmers; since the Tilapia farmers were mostly commercial farmers requiring larger investment,
and these loans were easier to get from financial institutions. As shown in the production section and
from the qualitative study, Tilapia farming requires more investment and fixed cost than carp farming,
almost four times more.

On average, the carp farmers took BDT 7,705 and the Tilapia farmers took BDT 28,452 as loan in 2018.
The farmers who could access financial services were calculated to be only 15 percent of male farmers
and 13 percent of female farmers. It was also found that 13 percent of male farmers were able to
receive sufficient loan from the different financial institutions while only 10 percent of female farmers
could receive sufficient loan from NGO and MFI. Female farmers characteristically have limited access
to finance.




9 Arotder is a market actor who provides a market place for producers (farmers) to sell their product and   35
wholesaler to buy from them in exchange of commission from both parties or either one.

With respect to age, the youth i.e. those below 30 were found to have slightly better access (17
percent) than those over 30 years (14 percent). The study team found that the younger farmers were
more knowledgeable about different financial services and therefore more efficient in communication
with the financial institutions.

Overall, only 12 percent of the male respondents and 9 percent of the female respondents reported
suitable loan repayment schedule that matched with the farming calendar. In terms of age, 11 percent
of the younger farmers (15-29 years) and 14 percent of the older (30+ year) farmers reported the
same.

The study found that most of the farmers did not use the loan money only for fish culture. Sometimes,
the money was also used for sudden medical expenses for family members, wedding and other family
occasions, as well as to repay other loans. It is very common practice among the farmers to use the
loan for mixed purposes. There are some seasonal loan schemes that banks offer for the agriculture
sector with comfortable interest rate. However, most farmers were found to be unaware of these
seasonal agriculture loans. The farmers also reported that they are not comfortable with the
paperwork hassle (formalities) required to get bank loan and thus they borrow preferably from the
MFIs and cooperatives which have high interest rates.

4.6 Crosscutting issues

4.6.1 Gender

Gender was given special emphasis in this study. In case of women’s participation, control over
income, norms and roles, statements of gender related perception, the study team asked the female
farmers (woman leading or managing fish farming) or the wives of the male farmers (where male
farmers are leading the farm work). For this part only, the team considered 200 female respondents.
This number (200) was determined purposively. However, these 200 female respondents were
selected randomly from the survey area. Desk research clearly suggested that women are heavily
involved in different stages of fish farming, study team wanted to learn their involvement areas and
dynamics.

The survey found that, most of the (90 percent) women participated in fish culture related HH
activities (this 90% include both female fish farmers or wives of male fish farmers). It was also found
from the interviews that women have a significant role in fish cultivation activities except harvesting
and pond preparation. 41 percent women were engaged in input purchase to a medium extent. In
general, the women had limited market access due to social norms and culture thus the lower
involvement of women in input purchase and fish sale activities.




                                                                                                          37

58 percent of the women farmers participated in selling fish to a small extent 10. It is not convenient or
considered culturally acceptable for women to carry large amount of fish from home to market. Also,
women themselves find the fishing and harvesting activities as laborious, which the men mostly take




                                      Figure 4.15: Women Involved in Fish Farming




care of. Women are mostly engaged in fish feeding, starting with preparing the homemade fish feed
and applying these as well as commercial feed to the pond. This is convenient for them because they
stay at home mostly, however they do not determine the feed requirement in most of the cases.

The involvement of women in decision-making about fish culture activities is not high. It should be
noted here that the female (farmers) respondents were only 4 percent in total sample. 22 percent of
the women respondents (female farmers and wives of male farmers) reported that they do not have

10 Small extent: 0-29% involvement in a particular activity,                                                 38
Medium extent: 30-60% involvement in a particular activity,
High extent: More than 60% involvement in a particular activity

any kind of decision-making power regarding fish culture activities, 48 percent may have some say. A
small percentage of 22 percent of the women respondents reported that they could take decisions on
their own.

With respect to the use of income from aquaculture, 35 percent women could express their opinion
about the use of income generated from aquaculture which were considered by family members; 24
percent can express their opinion, and sometimes influence the decision making; 23% had no income
at all. Only 13 percent women respondents reported that they could take final decisions on their own
about the use of income from fish culture.

Gender related perceptions: The survey found that cultural norms around women’ engagement in
aquaculture are quite discouraging. 68 percent of female respondents (out of total 200 female
respondents) believed that aquaculture is predominantly man’s work where women can only help
which is a typical perception in Bangladesh about women in all income generating activities. There is
lack of access to market for women as well. 64 percent respondents thought women should not got
to market places unless there is no man in the family. It is interesting that a lower percentage (34
percent) of respondents supposed that doing household chores is a women’s thing and men should
not bother about household chores. Over recent years, women have increasingly gotten involved in
income generating activities which has compelled other family members to share workload of HH
chores.

4.6.2 Environmental impact

Most the farmers try to keep the
pond area clean. Some farmers use
aluminum containers or plastic
drums instead of polybags when
transporting fish seed. Those who
use polybags for transportation,
reuse the polybags for other
purposes like carrying different
materials. Less than 10 percent of
the farmers throw away the
polybags instead of reusing.

A small number of famers throw
away the feed bags, while most (70
percent and more) reuse the bags to
store farm material or in protecting
pond dykes from erosion.

More than 50 percent of farmers
grow vegetables on the pond dykes.
Among fish farmers who grow
vegetables on the pond dyke, a
limited number of farmers (17
percent carp farmers and 10 percent
Tilapia farmers) use pesticides or
insecticide.    The other farmers
cultivating vegetables do not use
pesticide or insecticide because the
vegetable is a secondary crop for
them and the residue of pesticides
or insecticide may degrade the
water quality and harm the primary
crop of fish.

40 percent carp and 34 percent
Tilapia farmers) use Antimicrobial
Peptides (AMP) in ponds as aqua
medicine which is not a very good
practice; positively most of the
farmers did not know about the use
of AMP products. Those who used
this product, throw away the empty
containers or packets or bury these
after use.

                                                                           41

** The entire market analysis is in the Annex. The section below is an overview about market actors and their individual linkages in the fisheries value chain.




                                                                                                                                                                  43

5.1.1 Key features of seed market

The fish seed market is a dynamic market including different types of actors. The hatcheries source
the parent brood fish from a variety of sources, such as farmers, natural sources and government
brood banks and even nurseries. The hatcheries then supply the hatchlings to the nurseries, seed arot
and fry agents. The nurseries also collect the hatchlings from the seed Arots or fry agents.

After raising the hatchlings for one to three months, nurseries sell the fry to the farmers and fry
hawkers. There are also commission agents in the supply chain who link the nurseries to the farmers
in exchange for the sales commission. It was found in the primary data collection that the root level
small farmers source the fish seed mostly from the fry hawkers and sometimes from nurseries. Large
farmers collect the fish seed from both nurseries and hatcheries. The demand for the fish seed varies
based on their size and price in different regions.

The main concern of the seed market is the quality of the fish seed at the different stages of growth.
Good sources of seed are limited in Bangladesh, and as a result developing good quality spawn is a big
challenge for hatcheries. The management of the spawn is another major concern. If the management
and nursing is not appropriate, the quality of the spawn will fall, and this will affect the production of
fish. As mentioned, there are quality concerns of seed around many factors as well as on the later
stages pond and stocking management. The transaction of fish seed is completely based on the trust
as no one can ensure the quality.

5.1.2 Key features of feed and medicine market

In the feed market, the major portion of the feed supply is produced by large feed companies. There
are also many regional feed mills and local feed producers also who produce feed mostly for the
regional level. The feed companies/mills are mostly concentrated in the ZOI – especially Khulna and
Jashore districts.

In the case of aqua medicine, the manufacturing companies are mostly Dhaka-based. The distribution
channels of these feed and medicine producers are similar. They have dealers and sub-dealers in their
supply chain. The dealers are connected to the companies through their marketing officers. The
dealers order feed/medicine to the manufacturers through their marketing officers and collect the
delivery from regional depot or production units directly. Retailers source the feed/medicine from the
dealers.

The final customers for the fish feed and medicine are the farmers, hatcheries and nurseries. The
customers can source the feed and medicine from the dealers as well as the retailers. The large dealers
are mostly at the divisional and district level while retailers are at the root level making it easier for
the customer to buy nearer their farms.

In Bangladesh overall and as found in the ZOI, the availability of feed is not a problem however the
quality of the feed is a major concern. There a very few if at all any testing facilities, and so the
customers cannot be sure about the quality of the feed. With almost no monitoring and regulation,
feed companies have the opportunity to reduce the quality for greater profit. Another problem
identified in the feed market is that, some local feed mills produce low quality feed, selling these at
higher commission and longer credit facilities.


                                                                                                             44

Some dishonest dealers sell low quality feed in the market which affects the fish production and thus
the profits of the fish farmers. As a result, companies actually selling good quality commercial feeds
are not trusted by customers, many of whom are moving on to locally made cheaper feeds to at least
minimize on cost of feed. In case of medicine, the supply and access to good quality medicine is limited
and at the same time most of the customers have inadequate knowledge on how to apply medicine
in fish farming.

5.1.3 Key features of fish output/ sales market

In the fish (output) market, there are different kinds of actors in the different level of the supply chain
from producers (farmers) to final consumers. The farmers are mostly connected to the forias and
arotders for the sale of fish. Forias collect the fish from farmer’s doorstep. Sometimes they also
harvest the fish from the pond. In other cases, the farmers go to the nearby arots to sell the fish at
wholesale price.

The forias sell the fish in the arots after collecting them from a number of small fish farmers. Mostly
the wholesaler purchases the fish from these arots directly or through commission agents. There are
also small fish retailers who buy fish from arots and sell them to local markets. In this transaction, the
arots earn commission on the total sales. The wholesalers source the fish from the forias also and
supply to the large city market, super shops, and processors. The digital platform is a new concept of
the fish market nowadays who source the fishes from the wholesalers and sell to the final consumers
through their websites or Facebook pages.

With the low-quality seed and feed, the producers are not able to get optimum production and to
compound the problem further, the knowledge and practice of the farmers are also major limiting
factors. Most of the farmers interviewed in this study reportedly follow the traditional method which
is not effective in getting best production as well as in harvesting. Fish can also get damaged if they
are properly harvested.

The transportation channel and cold chain process is not well developed, as a result fish transported
over long distance get damaged affecting the quality and thus reduces the price of the fish in the
consumer market. The processing companies are few and weakly linked directly to the producers.
Overall, the consumers are not getting the good quality fish and the farmers get low price for their
production.

5.2 Baseline information of major market actors

5.2.1 Hatcheries

Hatcheries generally go to reliable sources to get the brood fish of carp and Tilapia and these
hatcheries maintain good relationship with their sources. Hatcheries mostly buy commercial feed and
select the feed based on the quality since the feed companies do not sell on credit. There are 26 feed
companies that are competing in the market11. Some of the companies have good quality nursery
feed. It is reported that Spectra Hexa feed (popularly known as Mega feed) has better FCR ratio as
well as quality feed for the brood fish.


11 Field interviews with hatcheries, 2019                                                                     45

5.2.1.1   Network Analysis

In case of sourcing carp eggs, the hatcheries largely rely on wholesalers, who they cannot entirely trust
and so try to buy as much as possible from known and reliable sources.

Approximately, half of hatcheries hold discussions among themselves about the problems they face
and how to solve these. The major concerns discussed include: how to solve the death of brood fish
and reduce the mortality rate during stocking. The hatcheries selling directly to farmers also share
technical knowledge about pond preparation and management. Medication advice is also given based
on the problems voiced. Approximately 50 percent of the customer base get this information flow. In
Patuakhali all the customers get the information and advisory service and 5 percent of the customers
are visited by the hatchery owners who advice better practices. Agents do not get any kind of
additional facilities. Approximately 20 percent of hatcheries discuss their problems with the
government fisheries extension officers to learn and identify solutions. All of the hatcheries participate
in the training provided by DoF.

5.2.2 Nurseries

There is an undefined number of nurseries in the aquaculture market in Bangladesh that nurse
different stages of fish fry. 12 Generally, nurseries buy fish hatchling or fry from hatcheries and raise
them to fingerlings or larger sized juvenile fish depending on the market size and demand of their
customers. In many cases, hatcheries also have nursing facilities and sell larger sized juvenile. Likewise,
it was found that some respondents run hatchery, nursery and also farming facilities simultaneously
in their compound. Sometimes even some fish farmers operate as nurseries based on the season
buying fry from hatcheries and raising them for both their own farm and then sell the surplus
production to other fish farmers.

The research team interviewed 10 nurseries in Feed the Future zone and ZOR. The size of the nurseries
varies largely according to their capacity and production volume. Eight out of ten nurseries produce
solely carp fingerlings and the other two nurseries produced both carp and Tilapia fingerlings.

5.2.2.1   Network Analysis

The nurseries are dependent on the hatcheries for their major input of fry and hatchlings. Nine out of
ten nurseries reported that they received information and advice from hatcheries. Hatcheries provide
information on production practices to the nurseries, so that the fries and hatchlings they sell grow
well and their own business can then expand. It was found that all the nurseries can communicate
with hatcheries through mobile phone when needed. The fry sourcing modality is mostly cash-based
where money is paid in advance through mobile banking services (e.g. bKash) or directly by hand.

The nurseries also connected to local feed retailers for feed and medicine inputs. Most of the nurseries
reported that they buy inputs from feed dealers or retailers mostly in cash. Sometimes they are able
to get credit if they have a good relationship with the dealer/retailer. In a few cases, nurseries have
formed business cooperatives (horizontal networking) through which orders are placed to purchase
seeds, feeds and medicines collectively (most of the times in credit) from suppliers/dealers/retailers.

12 FAO, 2015, Aquaculture seed and feed production and management in Bangladesh- Status, issues and           46
constraints

In general, the nurseries get information on use of feed and medicine from the feed and medicine
dealers and retailers. All of the nurseries surveyed claim that in 2018 they received this
information/advisory support from feed dealers/retailers. In a few cases, nurseries stated that they
received relevant information support from the technical officers of different feed and medicine
companies through the dealers.

All nurseries surveyed provided information services to the farmers on problems like excessive foul
gas in the pond, slow or no growth of fishes, shortage of dissolved oxygen in pond water and how to
take care of the pond preparation phase. They also advice on which fish to be cultured, according to
the pond condition and productivity of the pond. Farmers are able to communicate as needed over
the phone whenever they have any problems. Usually the main problems are around poor pond
preparation and the use of traditional farming management practices which hamper farmers’ fish
production.

While a positive relationship has been found between most nurseries and farmers, some farmers
believe that nurseries are responsible for losses in fish production as nursery supplied bad quality
fingerling. These farmers then, switch to another nursery for fingerling supply in the following season.
According to the nursery owners, this has been a major reason that they do not have long-term
customers. To overcome this issue, they try to make the farmers aware about the good pond
management, production and feeding practices to ensure a good harvest for the farmers and better
business for themselves. In addition, there are some credit transaction facilities in sale of fish fry selling
to known and trustworthy farmers. The transaction modality is usually in cash because there are a lot
of events of non-repayment. It is also found that sometimes the farmers cannot repay because of loss
of production due to natural disasters or diseases.

Even though the largest customers of the nurseries are fry hawkers, there is rarely any information
sharing among them. The fry hawkers are usually seasonal businessman, which is why they have
limited information transaction with the other market actors. On the other hand, nurseries get their
knowledge of market demand (farmer’s demand for particular type of fry) through the fry hawkers.
Another nursery customer are commission agents who link farmers with nurseries. As a service
payment, they get 10 percent commission over sales.

Nearly all nurseries, 9 out of 10, surveyed in Patuakhali, Bhola, Barguna, Jhalokati, Jashore and Satkhira
reported that they can access district DoF personnel for advice and information for any problem and
whenever they need to. In Bhola, however, nursery owners report almost no communication with DoF
personnel, NGOs or any private organization.

5.2.3 Seed arotdar (Fry trader/ trading hub)

The seed arotder is an input market actor who creates a temporary hub for Tilapia and carp seeds
collected from different nurseries from where he sells the seed to fish farmers, fry hawkers and
different small-scale nurseries. This type of market actor was only found in Jashore during the study.
The research team interviewed two seed arotders during the study.

Seed arotder stock seeds in the ponds maintaining hapa for a short time. They stock seed from
different sources on a rolling basis and sell to customers. The customers within the Feed the Future
zone are the main customers of seed arotders. Customers from Comilla and other districts come to

                                                                                                                 47

purchase seed from these arotdars. In 2018, main buyers from the seed arotders were small-scale fish
farmers who came to buy seed for their own ponds and for neighboring fish farmers. Some fry hawkers
bought seed on a regular basis (5-10 days intervals). Nearby nurseries also came to buy seed if they
found good quality seed.

5.2.3.1   Network Analysis

In the backward linkage, the seed arotder connects with nurseries to source seeds. They mostly buy
the seed with immediate cash payment which they report ensures they get best quality available with
the nursery. When sourcing large amount of seed, nurseries offer credit facilities as well for short
periods of time. In the forward linkage the seed arotder sells seeds to the farmers, fry hawkers and
some nurseries. The sales modality is mostly based on immediate cash payment, but sometimes they
give a limited credit facility to some of the farmers and nurseries they are well acquainted with.

Seed arotders do not receive any kind of training for stocking management and manage their stocks
for a limited time. They do not provide any information about fish culture and practices to their
customers.

5.2.4 Fry hawker

Fry hawkers act as intermediaries between seed producers and farmers. They buy fry and fingerling
from the nurseries and hatcheries and sell to the farmer’s doorstep. They carry the fry/fingerling in an
aluminum pot (Patil) or plastic drum. In most cases, fry hawkers do the business on a seasonal basis.
The research team interviewed 14 fry hawkers in the Feed the Future zone and ZOR to trace their role
in the aquaculture value chain and connection to the fish farmers.

5.2.4.1   Network Analysis

Fry hawkers act as intermediaries in the seed chain. They were found not to have many linkages with
any other market actors in the fish VC except the nursey/hatchery (supplier) and farmers (customer).
Since many fry hawkers do this as a seasonal business, the trust level is low and have fewer trusted
communication and relationships with nurseries and farmers. Fry hawkers even travel to different
districts and divisions for business where they are not well known by the farmers.

From both ends, they had some credit and knowledge transactions. Fry hawkers reported that they
had some credit facilities from the nursery and hatchery which was small in amount. The nurseries
and hatcheries gave credit to the fry hawkers only if the personal communication and trust had been
maintained for a long time. However, it is evident that they had to give more credit to the farmers
while selling fry/fingerling. Lesser credit payments were reported in 2018 and fry hawkers say that it
is common for 1 or 2 customers (farmers) to honor the credit in a year.

The knowledge sharing among these actors is present to a small extent. Nurseries sometimes convey
production-related information to the farmers through fry hawkers, but this is also rare. Nurseries
positively however get an understanding of market demand for their products through fry hawkers. It
is found that these actors communicated over phone to give orders for products.




                                                                                                           48

5.2.5 Feed company/mill

There are nearly 100 commercial feed manufacturers producing fish feed, livestock feed and poultry
feed in Bangladesh.13 There are also a number of local feed producers who produce and distribute
fish feeds locally. Though poultry feed is the major contributor of the feed market, the demand is
increasing for all feeds due to the production boost in all the sectors of aquaculture, livestock and
poultry.

Since the in-country yearly production of feeds per year is inadequate to meet domestic demand, feed
is also imported directly from India, China and other countries to fill the gap. The fish feed industry is
mainly concentrated around Mymensingh and Khulna regions, which also cover 70-80 percent of fish
farms in the country. 14 March through October is the peak season for fish feed production as the
market demand for feed is higher at this time.

Farmers prefer to use floating feeds more than the sinking feed however they cannot always afford it.
Also, in areas like Cox’s Bazar and Bandarban where fish farming is fairly new, the fish farmers think
that sinking feed is better - which is an incorrect perception. Most local feed mills cannot manufacture
floating feeds as they do not have the appropriate technology. The large feed companies like Mega
Feed has been one of the market leaders for commercially produced floating feeds, which many of
the poorer fish farmers cannot always afford.

The research team interviewed six feed company and mills in ZOI and ZOR zone. These companies and
mills produce sinking and floating feed for carp, Tilapia, pangus, shrimp and koi. End customers of the
feed companies and mills include fish farmers, nurseries and hatcheries. All feed companies and mills
interviewed except Mega Feed have their main customer base within the ZOI and ZOR zone. The local
feed mills of PCF, North Khulna and Niribili who mostly produce sinking feed and sell to customers in
their surrounding districts. The distribution channel of Mega Feed was found to cover the whole
country (especially a large part of northern and southern Bangladesh) with increasing sales every year.

5.2.5.1   Network Analysis

At the start of each year, the feed manufacturers collect the feed samples and price rate from the
suppliers and accordingly select the better-quality inputs at an agreed and reasonable price. The price
of inputs acts as the most important factor in determining the feed price. The overall relationship
among these actors is congenial and trustful.

Most of the time, there is no strict rule for the dealer, which limits them to take another company’s
dealership once they have signed with one. However, in the case of large companies like Mega, if a
dealer sells Mega’s feed, he cannot have a dealership to sell another company feed. This is a
requirement from Mega as they say trust issues arise if the dealers try to sell other low-quality feed
in the market because of the high commission which affect the company’s profit.




13 FAO, 2015, Aquaculture seed and feed production and management in Bangladesh- Status, issues and          49
constraints
14      DATABD.CO,         2019,      Animal       Feed       Industries,   Light    Castle      Partners.
(https://databd.co/profiles/industries/profile-animal-feed)

The research team found that some local feed mills produce feed and use the same packaging as few
large branded feed companies like Mega, Quality etc., basically, selling low quality feed with branded
name which then leads to eroding the farmer’s confidence about branded feeds. In a feed market like
this where farmers have little trust on the commercial feeds, these kinds of illegal and unethical
practices discourage the feed manufacturers also.

Feed manufacturers usually give some credit to the dealers, not usually a large amount. In most cases,
large companies give credit as a percentage of their procurement from the companies. There are
events of non-repayment of credit, which has forced companies to be restrictive about this. However,
local small feed mills do not have that kind of liberty in this matter. They have to provide credit to
dealers whenever needed to retain these dealers in their distribution system and expand their market.
From the dealer’s perspective, they have to give credit to their customers (farmers mostly) quite
frequently and in large amounts since most of the customers are marginal or small farmers who
cannot afford commercial feed. The dealers then get paid after the farmers sell their harvest, which is
a very common practice in Bangladesh. For this reason, dealers have expressed they need to get more
credit from the feed manufacturers to minimize their risk of non-repayment.

Feed manufacturers also provide production-related information and feed use support to the farmers
through their own consultants via the dealers. The manufacturers’ relationship in the regional and
local market is handled by their marketing officers. In feed market, the manufacturers set the price
and modalities of transaction between the company and the dealers.

5.2.6 Medicine company

There are various types of chemicals and drugs used in health management of aquatic animals, pond
preparation, soil and water management, improvement of aquatic productivity, feed formulation,
manipulation of reproduction, growth promotion processing and in value-added products.15 Also,
there are different kinds of antibiotic drugs used for the treatment of diseased fish, but there are no
authorized and specific medicine for fish in Bangladesh. The available products are basically water
treatment chemicals, minerals, feed nutrients for fish and fingerling production.

To trace the activities of aqua medicine companies, the research team interviewed two companies-
Eon Agro Industries Ltd and Green Dale Bangladesh Ltd. EON ventures in the aquaculture sector
started in 2002 in Khulna and Satkhira, as an Research and Development (R&D)-based project, and
now works in different areas such as pond water quality management, aquatic health and diseases
management, nutrition, stress and project management. Green Dale Bangladesh Ltd started as a
Bangladeshi company in 2016 and, in the aquaculture sector, they are marketing medicine as well as
feeds.

5.2.6.1   Network Analysis

The medicine companies mostly rely on import for their input sourcing, mostly from UK, Vietnam,
Thailand and India (Assam). Typically, these companies do not manufacture much medicine in their
own facility and therefore import, later packaging with their own label.


15 Rahman, M. Z., Khatun, A., Kholil, M. I. & Hossain, M. M. (2017) Aqua drugs and chemicals used in fish farms   50
of Comilla regions, Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies, 5(6), 2462-2473

The modality of the business between medicine companies and dealers is similar to the feed
companies. In a similar fashion, they communicate with dealers through their sales officers and
provide support to the final customers (farmers) through technical marketing officers.

The transaction between dealers and medicines companies is mostly in cash and sometimes in credit.
Companies face a parallel problem of disloyal dealers in the distribution system as described in the
case of feed companies. The products are generally tested by BFRI before getting No Objection
Certificate (NOC) from DoF.

Generally, after getting an application for NOC for new product, DoF sends samples to BFRI for lab and
field test. After getting clearance from BFRI, DoF issue NOC for the product. DoF is the regulatory
authority for fisheries but companies have to take a license on medicine and drug from “veterinary
drug regulatory wing” of DLS.

5.2.7 Dealer & retailer

Dealers and retailers are a significant part of the distribution channel of fish feed companies/mills and
aqua medicine companies (in aqua medicine companies, the dealers are called traders) and fish VC as
a whole. They are the intermediaries between the producer of the feed/medicine and final customers
(farmers). To trace out their roles and performance in the value chain, the research team interviewed
19 dealers and 5 retailers. Most of the dealers and retailers were found to sell both fish feed and
medicine. In 2018, it was evident that 10 out of 24 dealers and retailers sold Tilapia feed, and 14 out
of 24 dealers and retailers sold carp feed.

5.2.7.1   Network Analysis

It was found that the dealers and retailers do not have their own promotional activities. Feed and
medicine companies, with whom the dealers and retailers have agreements, arrange various kinds of
promotional activities like yard meetings and provide technical support for their products to increase
their sales.

In these activities, dealers and retailers’ function as a bridge between farmers and manufacturing
companies. In addition to giving a commission to the dealers, the companies arrange an annual
meeting and provide rewards based on sales to dealers to encourage product sale. Dealers were found
to organize farmer’s yard meetings and training on feed and medicine use and production practices
as a part of the promotional activities of the companies.

The research team also found that only a few dealers (3 out of the 24 interviewed) arranged yard
meetings on their own to increase their sale. They however provide advice on the use of feed and
medicine to their customers because in many cases, farmers are not sure about which product to use.
Dealers and retailers stated that they help farmers to choose the products to their requirements. Most
of the time, the farmers are confused about how to apply the medicine and chemicals.

This relationship was found to be the same with nurseries and hatcheries. The dealers report that
hatcheries seek help from them to find and communicate with potential customers (farmers).




                                                                                                            51

5.2.8 Local Extension Agent for Fisheries (LEAF)

In 2006, the DoF launched LEAF under the extension management along with other agencies and
partners to facilitate the small-scale farmers through advice, facilitation awareness raising and
technology transfer about fish culturing.

Under the National Agricultural Technology Program (NATP), Farmer’s Information and Advice Center
(FIAC) was launched in 270 upazilas of 57 districts. In this program many LEAF members were
appointed as Union Extension Facilitation Team (UEFT) members along with other agencies, partners
and NGOs for promoting the extension program.

5.2.8.1   Network Analysis

The connectivity of the LEAF is linear as they receive training and provide information and services.
LEAF members get training from the DoF, other development agencies or NGOs. Along with the
training, they receive a limited amount of equipment from DoF to test soil and water quality. Mainly
small-scale fish farmers and a few nurseries are connected with these LEAF members.

The few fish farmers and nurseries connected to LEAF, mainly get information about types of medicine
needed for disease prevention along with some knowledge about the pond preparation and stocking
management. These farmers avail of testing facilities from the LEAF members for a small fee.

As the LEAF services have not been extensively promoted, most of the farmers are not aware of this
service. Due to the limited knowledge about LEAF members, other actors like hatcheries and large
farmers are not interested about this service. This relationship was found to be stronger with nurseries
and hatcheries also.

5.2.9 Carp Pituitary Gland (CPG) processor

From the qualitative survey, the research team found different types of hormone usage among the
hatcheries. Many hatchery practitioners use synthetic hormones for breeding which are sourced from
either importer companies or large medicine companies who import from China and other countries.
Some hatcheries avoid synthetic hormones as they do not trust the quality. Some hatchery
practitioners collect raw pituitary gland of carp fishes from the local market and preserve these raw
in acetone/alcohol which are dried, ground and diluted in isotonic solution before being used. Few
hatchery practitioners use processed dry pituitary glands imported from India through local importing
companies or directly from the CPG processor companies.

The number of CPG processors in Bangladesh is limited. The research team visited one CPG processor
company (BANA supported Bangladesh United Agro Fisheries-UAF) in Jashore. The main product of
the manufacturer is the dried carp pituitary glands in pure acetone. They collect the raw carp pituitary
glands from different sources and process these in the laboratory to produce dried carp pituitary
glands pure acetone. The total employees at the company is approximately 50 people.

5.2.9.1   Network Analysis

With respect to backward linkage, the CPG processors relationship with fish cutters is through
collection agents. In case of the supply from India, two suppliers collect raw glands from the collection

                                                                                                            52

agents and supply to the company. Within Bangladesh, the fish cutters16 collect glands from fishes
they dress and cut and also collect glands from the nearby fish cutters. The collection agents collect
raw glands regionally and send these to the company. To establish this supply chain, the company has
trained a number of fish cutters across the region to collect and handle the raw glands correctly.

Fish cutters then sell the raw glands on cash to the collection agents. The collection agents receive the
payments after product delivery and sometimes they also advance from the processing in order to get
a confirmed supply of raw glands. The CPG company does an advance payment to the suppliers on
imported acetone and other inputs and machinery, are sourced from the local market. The major
problem in the backward linkage is the source and availability of the raw glands, as a limited numbers
of fish cutters are connected with this supply chain.

Poor market linkage with super shops and fish processing companies are also a reason for lack of
source of the raw glands. Another problem is that a majority of fish cutters do not have sound
knowledge and training on handling raw pituitary glands as a result many glands are damaged during
collection process.

In the forward linkage, the CPG processor sells the product to the hatchery practitioners through
dealers in the domestic market. In the international market, the company sells their product through
an online trading platform. The company shares knowledge of suitable practice of using the glands
with the hatchery practitioners through a sharing session. However, the overall lack of sound
knowledge among hatchery practitioners has limited the expansion of the customer base.

5.2.10 Equipment manufacturer

As the fish industry is now growing in terms of using more technology, studies are being conducted to
identify scope of improvement and need for further innovation. In addition, new actors are becoming
more and more interested in accessing the market and utilizing improved instruments to maximize
benefits for themselves as well as for the farmers. There are a few companies who manufacture and
import equipment used in aquaculture.

The research team interviewed an equipment manufacturing company in Jashore. The company has
set-up to manufacture solar based equipment for use in aquaculture. These machines are produced
based on their own expertise and design. They report that they have capacity to manufacture and sell
the following set of machines regarding fish farming:

    •    Fish egg shaking machine
    •    Underwater gas removing machine
    •    Solar fish feed production machine
    •    Solar water recycling and purifying system for fish hatchery
    •    Solar water pumping system




16 Fish cutters cut fish in the local market place                                                          53

5.2.10.1 Sales information

The company sold only three solar pump machines in 2018. Sales has been mostly through
development projects or initiatives and they do not have any marketing and sales distribution staff or
channel. The products were made according to buyer’s requirement. Promotional activities by the
company include seminar, TV shows (participating in relevant talk shows), newspaper advertisement,
providing leaflet to the dealers and retailers. Also, they are trying to collaborate with development
sector organizations to reach out to farmers.

5.2.10.2 Network Analysis

In the backward linkage, this company sources their necessary inputs from raw material suppliers. The
main buyers of the company are farmers, hatcheries and nurseries. The company connects with
buyers through promotional activities. Interested buyers place orders with their specific requirement
and the company supplies machines. The market linkage is very limited and most of the farmers are
not introduced with the new technology being developed and, as a result, sales are low.

The company has ten full time employees and thirty part time employees and have plans of hiring
students from polytechnic institutes. They have their own technical manpower to produce these kinds
of machines. However, they have not started

Currently their focus is on improving technical skills for their production workers. The company
finances business from their own fund and have not taken any loan from banks or other institutions.
They are trying to make a patent of their innovative machines but have failed to do so since there are
not enough experts to make patents for a new instrument.



5.2.11 Output market

To trace activities of the output market, the research team interviewed various output actors in the
fish VC of carp and Tilapia in the ZOI and ZOR. The surveyed output actors are foria, arotder,
commission agent, wholesaler, ice factory, fish trader’s association, small retailer, digital platform and
processor.

5.2.11.1 Network Analysis

Among other output level actors, foria and arotder are directly linked to the fish producers (farmers).
It is evident from interviews that farmers do not sell all of their fish at once. They contact forias before
harvesting. Foria then buys fish from a farmer’s doorstep and sells to an arot or wholesaler. In many
cases, forias buy fish in advance before harvesting assuming fish stock in the pond and harvest on their
own. Some forias give quotation based on fish species to the farmers for their fish. Arotder provides a
marketplace for fish auction in exchange for commission on sales. In arots, both foria and farmer come
to sell fish to the wholesalers.

The commission agent is another actor who links the arotder to a wholesaler in exchange of a
commission. Arots also store a small amount of fish in the freezer (if any) or in insulated boxes with
crushed ice procured from ice factories. They sell the fish to the wholesaler as early as possible. There

                                                                                                               54

is an overall lack of storage facilities for the arots. Respondents stated that it would be a more
profitable for them if they could store the fish in the freezer in peak season, especially since the fish
supply is not of the same amount every day.

Sometimes, when fish supply is low or absent, the arotders have to sit idly without business. The
research team found in Bagerhat that few arotders provide fish fry/fingerling to the small farmers with
the condition the farmers are bound to sell the fish to those specific arots after harvest. It was also
found that some small retailers (local) buy fish from the arots.

Wholesalers are a major part of the output market as a whole. They transport the fish from the local
level to the large city markets (like Dhaka). The fish are at risk of becoming spoilt during transportation
because of inadequate icing or freezer facility. Transportation delays are a very common issue in
Bangladesh due to traffic congestion, political unrest, ferry, etc.

Before reaching out to the final consumers, wholesalers provide the fish to the super markets (e.g.
Swapno, Agora, and Prince etc.) and small retailers. The research team also found digital platforms
(e.g. https://chaldal.com/) who procure fish from wholesalers and provide directly to the final
consumers through their website or Facebook page which is a new model of fish business. It is evident
that retaining fish quality until reaching out to the consumers is a major problem for the output level
actors. It was also found that the fish processors collect the fish from a wholesaler for processing.
Mostly, the processing units are concerned more with export of fish to the international market.

          RECOMMENDATIONS




                                     56

This section includes lessons learned and recommendations following data collection.

1) Feeding practice is poor at farm level due to lack of knowledge and lack of access to finance

• Relevant interventions should be taken to bring about positive changes at farmers’ knowledge,
behavior and practice levels

• Market actors including feed companies, dealers and retailers, seed hatcheries and nurseries need
to be leveraged to increase farmers’ accessibility to information and quality feed

2) Capital requirement is high in fish farming compared to other agro-production subsectors.
Unfortunately, large feed companies are shifting towards zero credit business policy. Coupled with
their lack of access to financial services, fish farmers’ feeding practice was found poor and irregular.

• Fish farmers associations can be formed and these groups/associations can be linked with financial
service providers (groups or associations are better guarantors for banks/ financial institutes)

• MFIs/NGOs can provide special (seasonal) “Feed Loan” where farmers will purchase feeds from input
dealers with the vouchers distributed by NGO/MFI; Dealers will submit the voucher to respective
NGO/MFIs and take the cash.

• It was observed in Cox’s Bazar, Bandarban, Barisal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Faridpur and Rajbari that there
is huge knowledge gap among farmers regarding inputs and production practice. Also, due to heavy
dependence on sea fish and the annual 65-day ban on fishing, the demand for white fish is rising in
Cox’s Bazar. Therefore, interventions related to seed and feed market development need extra
emphasis in the ZOR.

3) There is growing demand for live fish among middle-class and high-end customers, but supply
chain is poor.

• Supply chain can be developed from farmers to wholesale/ retail market end which will ensure
higher fish sales price at farmer’s end. In addition, live fish marketing facilities needs to be popularized
for better prices.

4) Malpractice at feed production and sales level due to lack of testing facilities and regulatory and
monitoring mechanism.

• Divisional/ regional level feed mill associations should be established and strengthened.

• The association can work to establish central lab facilities in Jashore/Khulna regions and make it
compulsory for member feed mills/ companies to test their products (each batch) regularly.

• They can also denounce dealers that default or sell bad quality feeds.

• The associations can lobby for reduce import tax and ease administrative procedures around raw
material import.

• Associations can also work with DoF to strengthen their monitoring on feed quality, etc.




                                                                                                               57

• DoF should come up with revised regulatory mechanism focusing on how to regulate malpractice
and feed quality in the market (both at company/ mill end and dealer/retailer ends) using their limited
workforce.

5) Lack of effective promotional strategies and sales initiatives from feed companies.

• Feed companies should invest more to reach pro-poor market as it would increase their market
competitiveness

•Feed companies should invest more in promotional tools like farmer demonstration plots; as the
study team found, farmers are easily convinced about a technology when they see the outcome.
Besides, DoF officials also said that when they find out about any successful demonstration, they
recommend farmers to use those particular technologies or products.

• More technical/extension officers should be appointed by the feed companies to improve farmer
level extension services (including improved knowledge, water testing and prescription service at farm
gate), improve their sales and brand image; besides, appointed technical officers should have relevant
academic background

6) Lack of reliable brood source in the Feed the Future zone to supply high quality broods all year
round.

• Expansion of genetically improved brood bank for carp and Tilapia in collaboration with other
agencies will improve the quality of hatchery produced fish seed.

7) Hatcheries do not have access to low-price high-quality CPG/ hormone.

• Hatcheries should be linked with local high-quality CPG sources (e.g. United Agro Limited)

•There should be more focus on exploring mono-sex Tilapia seed production without current practice
of hormone use.

8) High operational and maintenance cost and low cost-efficiency in hatcheries and nurseries.

• Mechanization of hatchery water management may be initiated to reduce the operation cost and
improve seed quality. Re-circulating water management system in hatcheries and nurseries should be
encouraged to reduce the uncertainty of water quality. Demonstration of recirculation water
management system in pond aquaculture may be initiated for better pond production system. In
addition, introduction of mechanical feeding devices may reduce feed wastage and ultimately
aquaculture cost.

• Solar energy-based technologies should be promoted among hatcheries, nurseries and large farmers
to reduce their operational costs and maximize service efficiency. Technologies including water pump;
egg shaking machine; harmful gas removal machine; etc. should be promoted; and hatcheries and
commercial farmers should be linked with relevant market actors.

9) District level hatchery association either does not exist or is inactive due to lack of leadership and
incentive structure.



                                                                                                            58

• The hatchery association can work to ensure hatcheries’ accessibility to better quality broods, lab
facilities, coordinated demand forecasting and timely sales

• Since the hatcheries of Jashore are more developed and productive compared to hatcheries in other
regions, there is scope to strengthen the present hatchery association.

10) Seed/ fish quality degrades during long-distance travel or transportation.

• The present transportation system affects brood, seed and harvested fish quality and sales price,
therefore improvement in the transport system should be one of the priority areas for the Activity.
Cold chain maintenance and low-cost oxygen supply system/ technology should be promoted
throughout the supply chain.

Attribution is defined as the ascription of a causal link between observed (or expected to be observed)
changes and a specific intervention. It represents the extent to which observed development effects
can be attributed to a specific intervention or to the performance of one or more partner taking
account of other interventions, (anticipated or unanticipated) confounding factors, or external shocks.
In simple terms, attribution refers to the amount of change that is due to a particular intervention out
of the total change that takes place17.

For BANA, the study team is proposing the following two potential attribution methods below.

8.1 Attribution method – 1

This has been a widely used method for attributing intervention results by market system
development projects. Under this method, “Market catchment area approach (geographic area
coverage)” and “Estimation based on procurement data” methods are applied concomitantly. In this
method, product/service users are identified and before-after situation is compared.

Because the BANA activity has adopted a facilitative role and will primarily work with private sector
actors, treatment or control group cannot be identified at the beginning of the Activity. Here “Market
catchment area approach” is applied for sampling and identifying the survey respondents during the
annual/periodic performance survey to validate the outreach number as well as adoption rate. During
the annual/periodic performance survey, a comprehensive sampling strategy should be followed to
identify the survey respondent from those catchment areas.

“Estimation based on sales data” method is applied to estimate the access outreach number. First a
list of dealers, retailers, sales agents and relevant distribution actors will be collected from the
contracted companies in their catchment area. Next, input/product specific total sales, by the
company distribution network in the Feed the Future ZOI during the reporting period will be collected
from each company, and then the farmer’s access outreach will be calculated on the basis of input use
per farmer per unit of pond area for individual production season.

After identification of product/ service users, before-after situation is compared and the attributable
result is estimated.

Major steps in measuring attribution in this method is presented below.

    •   The results will be measured through an annual performance survey at the farmer, partners
        and intermediary actor level.

    •   BANA’s private partners will submit the business progress report including the list of the
        distribution and supply network for each business item by season for each of the intervention
        implemented. Based on this information, BANA MEL team will visit related
        distributors/suppliers in order to identify the business catchment area.

                                                                                                             61

     •   The survey firm will identify the target clusters from the pre-generated list of hatcheries and
         nurseries, dealers, retailers, collectors, traders, suppliers, processors, farmer groups, agents,
         LSPs, financial agents, advisory and extension service providers within their market catchment
         area.
     •   Then the survey team will validate the list and the target cluster (catchment area) through a
         survey of the company, dealers, retailers, hatcheries, LSPs, agents, etc.
     •   Next, discussion with respective local VC actors, such as hatcheries, distributors, dealers and
         retailers, suppliers, service providers, processors of a catchment area are required to identify
         the key individual service recipients of respective business item.

     •   Through discussion with key identified individuals, survey team will get an estimate of
         potential number of producers for a specific business item and the approximate number of
         producers using the business item. Following this a list of adopted producer names will be
         completed.
     •   Once the listing operation has been completed, survey respondents will then be randomly
         selected using systematic sampling method.

     •   Finally, the HH survey will be conducted from the randomly selected farmers within the target
         cluster.

     •   Results will be reported under activity targets to report progress on the standard indicators
         on annual basis.

     •   Result summary of other custom indicators/Sub-IRs will be presented in the performance
         narrative report, annual progress reports and other reporting.

     •   Qualitative study blending with network analysis and sentinel indicator study will be
         conducted to measure systemic change which will be reported accordingly.
This method is further detailed in matrix given in Annex B.

8.2 Attribution method 2 - comparison group method

The BANA can also adopt Comparison groups (CG) method18 to measure intervention attribution. In
this method, a comparison group is selected during annual performance surveys to measure
counterfactual and thus calculate attributable results.

The first method, “Market catchment area approach” and “Estimation based on procurement data”
described above has to be first completed to identify treatment group members or service users and
then measure results or changes in the intervention period.

And then in order to estimate the counterfactual for a specific change, a (CG) has to be identified
which would be people with similar socioeconomic characteristics but not recipients of the activity
interventions). Baseline data is taken from the comparison group using retrospective method; present

18                                                                                                           62
Posthumus, H and Wanitphon, P (2015) Measuring Attribution: a practical framework to select appropriate
attribution                 methods,                      https://www.enterprise-development.org/wp-
content/uploads/RMMeasuring_Attribution_Overview_Case_September_2015.pdf

situation against the Activity indicators is also recorded from the comparison group members, and
then deducted from the baseline values; this value is treated as the Counterfactual. Then the
counterfactual is deducted from the treatment group results and attributable result is thus calculated.

The steps under this method are illustrated below.




However, there are two major drawbacks and disadvantages of this approach:

    1) Self-selection bias when potential beneficiaries decide to apply or use product/service
       supported through intervention, while others decide not to apply.
    2) It is very important to select an appropriate comparison group in this method to measure
       counterfactual. But it is often quite difficult to identify that appropriate comparison group
       that will reflect the similar characteristics as that of the intervention group. There exists
       selection bias as private actor usually target comparatively well-off producers.

9.2 ANNEX B: MARKET ANALYSIS

1. Hatchery
1.1 General information

The general information for hatcheries is given in the relevant section above in main text.

1.2 Procurement information

The Tilapia hatcheries collected brood fish from WorldFish TBN (Genetic hatcheries) previously and
directly imported from Thailand (AIT). In 2018, most of the hatcheries collected brood from BFRI
(Mymensingh), Nova. In Cox’s Bazar, the hatcheries collected from others farms nearby. Advance
payment has to be made to the brood fish. Tilapia broods generally release eggs after 6 months of
maturity, some of the hatcheries collect eggs at 6 months but most collects eggs after the Tilapia is
one year of age. Brood transportation is based on the distance, scope of additional oxygen supply and
brood tank support. During transportation, the broods are kept in net in the water tank so that the
brood does not get injured.

Previously the carp hatcheries collected brood from the WorldFish TBN (Genetic hatcheries) and also
from open-water sources. The carp hatcheries buy eggs from wholesalers who collect eggs from open
water sources such as nearby rivers. The hatchery at Katiadi, Kishoreganj source juveniles for brood
development from Jamuna and Halda River. In Patuakhali the broods are sourced from the local ponds
of the fish farmers or other hatcheries. The hatcheries develop brood fishes and select individuals for
better brood development. They keep the male and female brood fishes separate before breeding,
putting them together in the same pond at breeding time. In Barisal, the practice was a little different;
here the hatcheries keep only the female brood fishes in a pond where they add male brood semen
sourced from Jashore and Gournodi. The Barisal hatcheries use diverse sources of sperm to maintain
separate blood line and avoid inbreeding. Carp broods generally release eggs at the age of 1 years and
above. In case of Tilapia and carp broods, younger broods lay higher amount of eggs compared to
older brood fishes and it is good practice to collect eggs from the 1-3 years old brood fishes. So, every
year the hatcheries replace 20-30 percent of the stocked broods with the new broods. As there is
scarcity of good quality broods in some regions like Patuakhali; they use 3-year-old male brood fishes
and 5 years old female brood fishes for breeding.

In case of brood sourcing the hatcheries have to trust the sellers as they do not know how to ensure
the quality. According to them there is no way to ensure the quality of the brood before production.
Generally, to ensure the quality of the brood they source the brood from the reliable sources.
Sometimes they switch the sources if they learn about better sources. They get ensured when they
get better production. The hatcheries always try to get good brood fishes but they are not entirely
satisfied about the brood quality and were suggested to get from foreign countries to avoid the
inbreeding. One of the hatcheries in Jashore sourced brood from Malaysia which lay eggs in limited
amount but the size of the fish is much bigger than of those in Bangladesh. The hatcheries are not also
satisfied with the high price of the brood fishes. In Jhalokathi the hatchery interviewed are not
satisfied with the price of the spawn, claiming that the spawn wholesalers spawn collects from natural
source and sell at high price.


                                                                                                            74

Commercial feed is given to the Tilapia and carp brood. Mega, Quality, Paragon commercial feed are
popular. The hatcheries generally use floating feeds for Tilapia and sinking feed for the carp broods.
In Cox’s Bazar, one hatchery was found to use sinking feed for Tilapia since they have their own feed
mill. Sometimes locally made feed are given to minimize the feeding cost. Generally, all the hatcheries
use oil cake, wheat, corn, fish meal and other feed ingredients to make the local crumble feed. In
Jhalokathi, the hatcheries use egg yolk in making the local feed along with the other ingredients. For
disease prevention some hatcheries use different types of probiotics based on advice from DoF
officials and local consultants and source these from the local animal medicine shops. The hatcheries
are satisfied with the quality of the commercial feeds. But to the hatchery operators report that the
credit facilities are limited.

In the Tilapia hatcheries hormone (100gm-costs 48,000 BDT) and Ethanol/Alcohol (200 Liters-costs
48,000 BDT) are sourced from Chittagong, Jashore and Mymensingh. Some of the Tilapia hatcheries
source from local hormone shops and agents. For carp the hormone (Ovaprim costs 2200
BDT/1000ml) are procured from the local animal medicine shops and sometimes from the regional
wholesale animal medicine market. There are two types hormone (dry and wet) available and used by
hatchery operators. Most of the hatcheries use dry hormones. Hormones are transported via S.A
Paribahan (courier service) and others transporting companies and courier services. Ethanol/Alcohol
are also transported in same manner or using mini-truck.

The sourced hormones for Tilapia give different results. In Khulna, Jashore, Barisal areas the result
showed up to 98 percent success rate in getting mono sex Tilapia fry. But in Cox’s Bazar it was low (40-
60 percent) compared to other regions. This is because the farmers in Cox’s Bazar do not use container
to apply hormone. They apply hormone in hapa19 which reduces the applicability of the hormone.

Most hatcheries operate for 9-10 months in a year, remaining closed for 2-3 months in winter. To
manage the hatcheries, 5-10 permanent staff according hatchery size are hired who are paid on a
monthly basis the permanent staff work for 6-8 hours daily in the hatcheries and among these, those
who have experience and have technical knowledge work as technician and paid 10000-15000 BDT
per month. The other staff are paid 7000-10000 BDT per month based on their work. New staff work
as assistant to the seniors and paid 5000-6000 BDT per month. The hatcheries also employ daily
laborers during netting and pond reconstruction etc. The rate of the daily labors varies based on the
season and region which is in the range of 400-1000 BDT/day. The food cost of all the staff and laborers
are borne by the hatchery owners.

Most of the hatchery owners or the responsible managing staff report having gotten training from
WorldFish, Upazila Fisheries office, other NGO and INGOs and Hatchery trading associations (regional).
In Jhalokathi and Barisal the hatcheries staff received training from WorldFish, Jubo Unnoyon Somiti.
Previously few hatcheries got technical support from WorldFish. Hatcheries also seek external
technical advisors.

All the Tilapia hatcheries dry out all the ponds after every cycle of production. They dry the ponds in
rotation to conserve the stocks. All of the hatcheries apply zeolite and lime in the pond after drying.
To maintain the water quality, fertilizers and composts are applied to the ponds. Very few hatcheries

in Khulna and Jashore apply medicine in the pond water. In Cox’s Bazar, one hatchery reported the
application of raw cow dung in the pond.

1.3 Sales information

The hatcheries generally sell the spawn to nurseries, farmers and fry agents. The hatcheries which
have nursing facilities sell fingerlings to the farmers and fingerling agents. In all the visited areas
hatcheries mostly sell the spawn to the nurseries. Farmers who have nursing facilities buy spawn from
the hatcheries. The fry agents buy from the hatcheries in large amounts and sell to the nurseries and
farmers across the region. The hatcheries normally sell spawn and try to make the profit from first 50
percent the total production, after which point, they usually reduce the price to ensure continued
sales. The hatcheries with nursing facilities, grow fingerlings and then grow the remaining unsold
fingerlings into table fish.

Previously spawn counting was difficult but now it is measured according 50 gm weight of spawn using
a digital scale. And then these are counted in a bowl. Based on this count they can calculate the
number of the spawn per kg. The buyers directly contact with owners or the managers of the
hatcheries for purchase of the spawn. Tilapia is sold piece wise or per kg containing 4000-5000 pieces.
The hatcheries grade the spawns during selling. Medium sized spawns are sold at regular price and big
sized spawns are sold separately since these get a higher price. Transaction is usually cash-based,
giving credit to a few known and reliable buyers. The credit limit is 5 to 20 percent and usually returned
within 6 months. The fry agents do not get any credit facilities since they are not always reachable and
cannot be trusted to repay the credit.

The sale price of the spawn depends on the market demand. In Jashore and Jhalokathi, the price is
decided based on the Jashore seed market. In Patuakhali, the price is reduced to compete with the
Comilla market prices. In other regions the price is decided based on the market demand and quality
of the product. If the quality of the product is higher the price will be higher. The sale price of spawn
is 3000-5000 BDT/kg (3000-4000 spawns per kg). If the quality and size of the spawns are better, the
price is higher. Sometimes the market demand is so low that the hatcheries sell the spawn at BDT 0.2
per piece.

The hatcheries that have been operating for a longer time are well established as they have built their
customer base, local and national level demands and understand their market share in competition
with other hatcheries. They well versed in the quality of their product as well as that of other
hatcheries and can predict the future market demand and also their future market share.

All the hatcheries have yearly target for spawn production which they strive to increase in amount
and improve in quality based on market demand.

The hatcheries normally consider 42 kg as 1 maund 20 taking into account the water in fish gills
(especially for carp), also an extra 10 percent of spawn are given to the buyers to minimize the




                                                                                                             76

mortality and loss during transportation. Most of the hatcheries are satisfied with their sales except
for those needing to reduce prices as in Jashore, Comilla, Patuakhali and Jhalokhati.

1.4 Product distribution network and market promotion

The hatcheries plan spawn production according to their maximum capacity and market demand. The
hatcheries mainly sell their produce to farmers, nurseries and the commission agents. The farmers
and nurseries who buy the spawns are nearer to the secondary hatcheries. The Jashore and Khulna
hatcheries have customers across the country since they are known to have good quality spawns.
Other hatcheries also have few customers outside their own area. A few hatcheries sell a small amount
of spawn to the fry hawkers but most have stopped doing so. In Jashore, however, the hatcheries sell
their produce to the seed arotder from whom fry hawkers, farmers and nurseries buy the spawn. The
commission agents buy from the hatcheries and sell the spawn in other region to the nurseries and
large farmers.

50 percent of the visited hatcheries sell their spawn with their labels (which include their brand name,
address and contact number) on the oxygen bags in which the spawn is transported, to promote their
hatchery and brand. The spawn gone through an adapting process and transferred to the oxygen poly
bags (800-1000 spawns in 5 liter) which is prepared by the hatchery employees. The number of spawn
per bag is determined by the distance of travel, so if the spawn is going a long distance, the density of
the spawn is reduced accordingly. The buyers manage the transportation, usually using use pickups
and if the quantity is much larger, then trucks are used.

The hatchery owners consider the quality of the seed as their biggest promotion. If the quality of the
seed is good and current customer is satisfied with the product, then the hatchery will be promoted
to other farmers leading increasing the number of customers In Patuakhali, the visited hatchery
reported that they give 2 kg free fry to three to four of the highest buying and regular customers. Also,
if any customer buys 10 kg fry then transportation is free.

1.5 Source of finance

It was found that 50 percent of the hatcheries visited
finance the hatchery business with the owner’s own
capital or from any of his other businesses. Some take
loan to invest or expand, which may be from
commercial banks (Matshya21 or Fisheries Loan),
usually for infrastructural improvements and
sometimes from MFIs for operational management.
Very few hatcheries can take loan from co-operatives.

Generally, all the hatcheries try to avoid giving credit facilities to their customers; sometimes giving 5-
20 percent credit to maintain the business.

1.6 Network analysis

Hatcheries maintain a good relationship with sources for brood fish if they consider it reliable. Since
feed company’s do not offer credit, the hatcheries buy feed based on the ones with reportedly good
quality and also based on what they can afford There are 26 feed companies among which Mega feed
has better FCR ratio; Quality feed is also popularly used for the brood fish. In case of collection of carp
eggs, hatcheries rely on the on the wholesalers, even though it is not a reliable source.

Hatcheries consult among themselves about problems faced and possible solutions. Main discussions
are around the unexpected death of brood fish and how to reduce the mortality rate during hatching
and transportation.

Hatcheries share technical knowledge about pond preparation and management, medical advice with
the farmers who are their customers. In Patuakhali, all the fish farmers get this advisory service. 5
percent of the customers are visited by the hatchery owners for advice better practice. Agents do not
get any kind of additional facilities from the hatcheries.

The hatcheries discuss their problems with the fisheries extension officers for trouble-shooting (20
percent of total). All of the hatcheries participate DoF training sessions.




                          Figure 9.1: Information Flow among Actors related to Hatcheries

1.7 Market barriers and problems they face

1.7.1   Brood quality

There are not enough sources of good quality brood fish in the country and within each locality. Good
brood fish are usually highly priced and mortality of these are also high as they come from far places.
Some seed sellers mix other local seeds with the open source seeds (which are from the Halda22 River)
and therefore quality is not always good and reliability and trust is a concern in these transactions.

1.7.2   Input quality and accessibility




22 The Halda River is the one and the only natural carp breeding ground in Bangladesh                         78

The price of the feed increases in the peak reason. Sometimes the hatcheries had to hide to the
transport agencies regarding the Hormone and Alcohol issues because of security of these high valued
products. Getting formalin and polybag is a problem in Bhola. Carp pituitary gland and hormones are
not always accessible and price of the products are high.

1.7.3   Management problems

Most of the hatcheries do not have any bio-security arrangements. Any outsider can access the
hatcheries. Animals and birds also can access the hatchery and affect the brood and spawn. There are
inadequate lab facilities to test the mono sex conversion rate, input and medicine quality. The
hatchery owners in Barisal report not giving enough food and also death of mother fish due to lack of
oxygen where the ponds are old and ill-maintained. Labor scarcity at rice harvesting season is another
concern as people prefer not work in water. As the cost of brood, labor, seed, feed and transport has
increased, the production cost has thus increased, however sales value has not complementarily
increased. Overall, hatcheries find it difficult to make profit with incurring high production cost. In
Barisal furthermore, there is the problem of theft of brood fish since the hatcheries and are not that
secure.

1.7.4   Production problems

There is market demand for the good quality spawn but without good quality brood it is difficult to
meet the market demand. Most hatcheries were found to have staff with technical knowledge on how
to increase spawn production, but not enough capacity in terms of infrastructure and other resources
to produce according to target.

1.7.5   Sales problems

The market linkage is not strong enough and marketing strategies are also weak since s there are no
sales agent for carp hatcheries. A few Tilapia hatcheries have some number of agents to promote their
sales. The quality of the seed is usually good but if the nurseries do not manage them well, the farmer
will not get good production. As a result, this erodes the hatchery’s e reputation. In 2018, many
hatcheries report that have unpaid credit that were given to nurseries and farmer. In 2018, some
hatchery owners had to reduce the price of the spawn to compete with the markets of Jashore and
Comilla. Hatchery visited in Patuakhali report that they have to face theft and hijacking during
transportation of fish fry from Jashore route.

1.7.6   Licensing issue

The hatchery owners face police harassment in transporting chemicals (like Formalin and Alcohol) and
hormone with respect to license papers. They constantly face police harassment though they have
trade license from the Upazila Office.

1.7.7   Source of finance

Most of the hatcheries prefer not to take loan since they have to give bribe to get loan and the interest
rate is high with monthly payments, making it difficult for them since they only make product when
sell at end of season.


                                                                                                            79

1.7.8   Social stigma

There is a social stigma about the Tilapia fish. If the quality is properly maintained, it can be sold live
in the market. Overall people have a negative perception about cultured fish, which is changing
gradually. Carp fish has a high demand in the market. If the quality of the fish and the post harvesting
process is properly maintained, then cultured fish can get a good market share.

1.7.9   Environmental change

The water quality of Satkhira region is changing gradually, the quality of spawn is deteriorating due to
water quality as a result of heavy metals and salinity. Rainy season has changed to being usually
delayed at a time when water is required for the hatchery but it is not available. Higher temperature
during April-May hampers Tilapia spawn development in hapa.




                                                                                                              80

2. Nursery
2.1 General information

There are a large number (not defined) of nurseries in the aquaculture market in Bangladesh that
nurse different kinds of fries. 23 Generally, nurseries buy fish hatchlings or fry from hatcheries and raise
them to fingerlings or larger sized juvenile fish depending on the market demand of their customers.
In many cases, hatcheries also have inbuilt nursing facilities and sell larger sized juveniles. Likewise, it
was found that some respondents had hatchery, nursery and also farming facilities in their compound.
In some cases, the fish farmers do the seasonal nursing business. They buy fry from hatcheries and
raise them for their own farm and sell the surplus to other farmers.

The research team interviewed 10 nurseries in ZOI and ZORZOR. The size of the nurseries varies largely
according to their capacity and production volume. 8 out of these 10 nurseries produced only carp
fingerlings while two produced both carp and Tilapia fingerling in 2018.

2.2 Input sourcing

In 2018, the nurseries in Patuakhali, Bhola, Barguna, Jhalokathi, Faridpur and Satkhira were found to
collect most of its carp hatchlings and Tilapia fry from different hatcheries located in Jashore because
of lack of quality hatchery in their own locality. It is evident that Jashore has been a major hub for fish
hatcheries because of its long-term reputation in the aquaculture practice. Unfortunately, hatcheries
are few in the other FTF and ZOR districts. This has been a major reason for lack of access to good
quality fries for the nurseries in these districts. Only the nursery owners that have to access to the
Jashore hatcheries and/or can buy collectively (large amount) from Jashore hatcheries reported that
they have access to good quality fish fry. Otherwise, it is difficult for them to ensure good quality fries
at a convenient price.

Generally, the nursery owners try to make sure about the quality of brood of their supplier hatcheries
(through checking the brood fish before egg collection) and then order for hatchlings or fry with
advance payment if the quality and weight are satisfactory. The nursery surveyed in Barguna was
found as an exception; it sourced fry from a nearby hatchery which is claimed to be very good in
quality. Nurseries visited in Faridpur belong to a cooperative society where they place orders to
procure collectively from Jashore based hatcheries and report that this ensures good quality, timely
delivery and lower cost of transportation.

The price of Tilapia fry varies from BDT 60,000 to 70,000 for 100,000 pieces. The price for one kg carp
hatchling varies from BDT 3000-5000 (the price of Catla hatchlings is higher than Rui, Mrigal and other
carp hatchlings). The price varies seasonally, and it increases during peak nursing season.

Most of the nurseries use ready factory-made industrial feeds (commercial feed) from local feed
retailers along with some homemade food. It was also found that a few nursery owners buy feed
ingredients from local market (rice bran, oil cake, etc.) and process feed for their nurseries (usually




23 FAO, 2015, Aquaculture seed and feed production and management in Bangladesh- Status, issues and            81
constraints

from local feed crushing/mixing mills). From their perspective, this practice ensures the feed quality
as they are not confident about the commercial fish feeds.

2.3 Production and sales

Nurseries usually nurse the carp hatchlings for on an average 1-3 months and Tilapia fry for around 20
days before selling to farmers. Production of larger sized fry in nurseries is expensive as it requires
extra space, more feed and also a longer rearing period. Injuries, fry muscle wound, and parasitic
diseases were reported as common problems in all nurseries visited. Infectious viral and bacterial
disease are rare and slow or stunted growth due to malnutrition and inbreeding are occasionally
observed. There are regular problems around low dissolved oxygen and high ammonia and other foul
gases deteriorating pond water quality. The Satkhira nursery that was visited was found to have
difficulties in selling their fries on time in 2018 because farmers were not able to prepare their ponds
because of late rains and increased water salinity. Some nurseries make larger nursery ponds so that
they can rear or grow fries/ fingerings to marketable size (as fish farmers do) to counter this problem
and be able to make a profit.

The research team found that in 2018 the nurseries nursed mostly carp fries (80 percent); only 2 of
the 10 nurseries (20 percent) were found to nurse Tilapia fries. The total annual production (carp &
Tilapia) varies largely according to nurseries and district location. In 2018, production from most of
the nurseries ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 metric ton. The Barguna nursery nursed carp fingerlings for a
longer period of time to a higher weight range and sold these when there were 150 pieces of
fingerlings in one kg.

Similar to the annual production, the annual sales of the nurseries vary based on production capacity
and fingerling size. As we can see in the figure that, the nurseries in Faridpur had higher sales volume
in 2018 where there are two comparatively large nurseries with a higher production capacity. Most of
the nurseries interviewed are small in size.

In general, 70-80 percent customers of nurseries are fry hawkers and 20-30 percent are fish farmers.
In addition, in few areas (like Barguna) fingerling agents have been found who link the farmers or fry
hawkers (customers) to nurseries through mobile phone in exchange of 10 percent commission. In
these areas, commission agents control 15 percent of the market sales from nurseries to farmers. It




                            Figure 9.2: Annual Production and Sales of the Nurseries



                                                                                                           82

was found in Barguna that DoF and different NGOs collect fingerling from local nurseries for open
water stocking and also for distribution among the project beneficiaries. The nursery owners forecast
their demand mostly based on the previous year’s sale.

2.4 Source of finance

The major source of finance for the nurseries has been the
cooperatives, mostly because of easier accessibility and delivery of
loan. 9 out of 10 nurseries have reported that their major sources of
finance are cooperatives and MFIs. Some nurseries take loan from MFIs
(Micro-Finance Institutes) like BRAC because they provide free fry
sometimes under their financial package. In general, nurseries feel
more comfortable borrowing from NGOs and cooperatives even if with
the high-interest rate compared to different government banks which
have complex paperwork and delays in the borrowing process. Also,
banks are usually not interested in giving small loans which the             Figure 9.3: Source of Finance

nurseries often require (for operational purpose). Therefore, a
significant portion of their investment comes from own source or reinvestment from previous year’s
sales revenue. In spite of all the constraints mentioned, the investment of the nurseries was found to
be increasing over the years and business is expanding also. For nurseries, average increase in annual
investment was found 5-10 percent in 2018.

2.5 Network analysis

The nurseries were found dependent on the hatcheries for their major of input fry and hatchlings. 9
out of 10 nurseries interviewed reported that they got information support from hatcheries. As
mentioned above hatcheries provide production practice-related information to the nurseries. It was
found that all the nurseries can communicate with hatcheries through mobile phone when needed.
Hatcheries also try to provide information service in order ensure that their sold fries and hatchlings
are raised well so that their business can expand. The fry sourcing modality is mostly cash based where
money is transacted in advance through mobile banking services (e.g. bKash) or by hand.

The nurseries are also connected to local feed retailers for feed and medicine sourcing where
transaction is mostly in cash and sometimes credit if they are well known to each other. In a few cases
nurseries formed business cooperatives (horizontal networking) that can place collective orders to
purchase seeds, feeds and medicines (most of the times in credit) from suppliers/dealers/retailers. 10
nurseries surveyed reported that in 2018 they received information on use of feed and medicine use
from the feed and medicine dealers and retailer retailers.

All the nurseries provide information services to the farmers on problems like removing foul gas in the
pond, slow or stunted no growth of fishes, shortage of dissolved oxygen in pond water and how
prepare ponds. Other technical suggestions include what fish to be cultured according to the pond
condition and productivity of the pond. Farmers communicate with nurseries over the phone when
they require information and advice. However, in most of the cases, farmers believe that nurseries
are responsible for their loss in fish production as nursery supplied bad quality fingerling and then
they switch to another nursery for fingerling supply.


                                                                                                             83

According to the nursery owners, this has been a major reason that they do not have long-term
customers. To overcome this issue, they try to make the farmers aware about the good pond
management, production and feeding practices to ensure a good harvest for the farmers and better
business for themselves. In addition, there are some credit transaction facilities when fingerlings a
sold to known and reliable farmers. Mostly the transaction is in cash because there are a lot of events
of non-repayment. It is also found that sometimes the farmers cannot repay because of loss of
production due to natural disasters or diseases.




                                  Figure 9.4: Information Flow among Actors


Even though the largest customers of the nurseries are fry hawkers, there is rarely any information
sharing among them since the fry hawkers are seasonal and opportunistic businessman. On the other
hand, the nurseries get information of market demand (farmer’s demand for particular type of fry)
through the fry hawkers. Another customer of nurseries is commission agents who link the farmers
with nurseries. As a service payment, they get 10 percent commission over sales.

Almost all the nurseries (9 out of 10) surveyed in Patuakhali, Bhola, Barguna, Jhalokati, Jashore and
Satkhira reported that they can access the district DoF personnel for advice and information for any
problem. Only in Bhola, the nursery owners reported that they have barely any communication to the
DoF personnel, NGOs or any private organization.

2.6 Market barriers

2.6.1   Quality fry & hatchling

The overall satisfaction level of the nurseries over the fry/hatchling quality is low. Most of the
nurseries interviewed reported that there are problems like malnourished fish fry/hatchling, mixed
fish species and low-quality brood. In many cases, parent brood (male and female) fishes are not kept
separate in hatcheries which decreases the fry quality.


                                                                                                          84

Regarding Tilapia hatchling, the nurseries reported that hatcheries usually do not use adequate
amount of hormone for monosex Tilapia fry. As a result, Tilapia hatchlings remain multi-sex. These do
not grow quickly in nurseries and farmers give negative feedback about their harvest. These practices
reduce the profitability of the nurseries. The nurseries report that hatcheries using improved Tilapia
broods (e.g. from WorldFish, BFRI or imported broods from foreign countries) produce high quality
fries.

In addition, lack of hatcheries in nearby areas is another major reason for lack of access to the quality
fry for most of the interviewed nurseries. The nurseries have to come to Jashore if they want to access
a good quality hatchery but which does not always ensure good quality fry always. Furthermore, long-
distance transportation (often without oxygen supply) increases mortality rate of the fry.

2.6.2   Mortality rate

There is a 5 percent mortality rate of the fry during transportation from hatchery to the nursery
because of oxygen shortage or temperature imbalance. Nurseries mostly use oxygen tablet or cylinder
during long distant fry transportation. But delay on the road due to heavy traffic, bad road condition
and other reasons increases the mortality rate.

2.6.3   Illegal practices

All of the nurseries interviewed reported that often they have to bribe police and trade/political
associations during fry transportation (as use of polythene is prohibited). In case of feed sourcing,
sometimes they get low quality or adulterated feed from feed dealers which hampers their business
significantly.

2.6.4   Lack of information

Most of nurseries we interviewed reported that they have a lack of knowledge and proper training on
necessary pond preparation, water management and stocking density. Also, nursery operators have
limited accessibility to weather forecast and relevant information.

2.6.5   Poor market forecasting

Mostly the nurseries forecast their demand according to the previous year’s sale and market
preferences. But often, farmer’s preference changes due to factors such as poor market price, lack of
rain and other reasons, which affects nursery business as nursery owners cannot accurately forecast
demand and make safe business plans.

2.6.6   Other constraints

There are also some challenges like lack of skilled labor in peak season, water crisis and lack of rainfall
during production period (as smallholders are heavily dependent on natural rainfall for water supply).
In many cases, these constraints force nurseries to go for delayed production which reduces the profit
margin. Also, they reported that prices of fry (seed) and fish feed are high and volatile which directly
affects their production cost and sales price.




                                                                                                              85

The pricing of the fingerling depends on the nursery production costs and market demand. The
fingerling price is usually determined by the nurseries. One kg of carp fingerling is sold at BDT 150. For
Tilapia, 3 inches sized fingerlings are sold at BDT 2/piece and BDT 150 for one kg of 5-inch fingerlings.




                                                                                                             86

3. Seed arotder

3.1 General information

The seed arotder is an input market actor who creates a temporary hub of Tilapia and carp seeds
collected from different nurseries and then sold to seeds to fish farmers, fry hawkers and different
small-scale nurseries. This type of market actor was only found in Jashore during the study. The
research team interviewed two seed arotders.

Seed arotder stock the seeds in the ponds using a hapa for a limited time. They stock the seeds from
different sources on an on-going basis and sell to the customers. The customers within the FTF zone
are the main customers of seed arotders, beside this they also have customers from Comilla and other
districts. In 2018, main buyers from the seed arotders were the small-scale fish farmers who came to
buy seeds for himself and sometimes for his neighboring fish farmers. Some fry hawkers bought seeds
on regular basis at 5 to 10-day intervals. Nearby nurseries also came to buy seeds if they found good
quality seeds.

3.2 Procurement information

Seed arotders source both Tilapia and carp seed from different nurseries, especially large nurseries,
so that they can get regular supply of seeds. While buying they take 100 piece per kg for carp and
2000-2500 piece per kg for Tilapia. Also, they check the quality of the seeds like movement against
current and avoid the spotted seed. In 2018, the price of carp seed per kg was BDT 250-300 and the
price of Tilapia seed per kg was BDT 4000-5000. They generally source the seed from the nearby
nurseries located in Jashore. As they source large amount of seeds and the seed size is ¾ inch, the
price of each seed is about 60-90 paisa.

The seed arotders are connected with the transport agencies. Normally they transport the seed on
local motor vehicle called Nosimon24 which carries drums of water and this water is continuously
stirred to ensure oxygen supply. If the quantity of the seed is above 50,000 pieces, they hire pickup
vans with oxygen supply support for carrying the seeds. The rate per trip was BDT 3,000 in 2018, they
cover 40-50 kilo to reach the seeds. The mortality rate of seeds during transportation was 2-5 percent
in 2018. As they source different quality seeds from different sources, it is hard to keep this separately
as there is space scarcity.

To establish the temporal hub, they lease ponds and use hapa to stock the seed. In 2018, the lease
cost for each pond was BDT 60,000 yearly and the maintenance cost per pond was BDT 20,000. The
seed arotders interviewed had 2-4 ponds to run their business in 2018. They provide only oil cake
sourced from local feed mills. If they observe any disease among the seeds, they apply medicine with
feed bought from local medicine shops.

From the observation and interviews it was found that seed arotders follow traditional methods for
handling and managing the seeds. Lack of knowledge degrades the quality of the seeds. From the
interviews it was found that they get lease for a short time period and lease cost is therefore high and
now increasing an alarming rate. As a result, the capital cost of the business is increasing yearly.

3.3 Sales information

In 2018, the sales of every seeds arotder was 3-4 million piece of seed per month. Most of the time
they source seeds from the nurseries on cash. Sometimes they source seeds on credit and return the
money within a week. As they stock the seeds for a limited time, their profit margin is 10 percent of
sourced price. The seed arotders keep little profit margin so that they can increase the sales volume
to reach their desired profit from the business.

Generally, they only have cash transaction and do not give credit facilities to the fry hawkers since the
fry hawkers come from different districts and are not reliable. Credit is given to only a few nearby
farmers and nurseries who are well known to them for about2-3 months.

The customers who buy from seed arotders manage their own transportation. Different fish farmers
or fry hawkers arrange transport in group. Sometimes seed arotders help the customers to get contact
with transport agencies.

As a promotional activity they use different names of hatcheries to increase the trust of the customers.
From the observation of the research team it was found that, in reality there is no hatching facilities
even the source of the seeds was not authentic.

3.4 Source of finance

The seed arotders manage their own capital cost and sometimes take loan from cooperatives and
MFIs. Sometimes they avail of credit from the nurseries and return the money after sales.

3.5 Network Analysis

With respect to backward linkage, the seed arotder is connected with the nurseries for sourcing seed
usually through immediate cash transaction to ensure they get best quality seed. When procuring
large amount of seed, nurseries offer credit facilities for a limited time.

In the forward linkage the seed arotder sell the seeds to the farmers, fry hawkers and some nurseries.
Here too, it is mostly cash transaction with some credit offered to known farmers and nurseries.

The seed arotders do not receive any kind of training for stocking management and manage their
stocks for limited time. They do not provide any information about fish culturing and practices, as they
are not interested.

3.6 Market barriers and problems they face

3.6.1   Capital investment

The major problem to run the business is high capital investment. The lease cost of each pond is very
high compared to other areas and it is increasing yearly.

3.6.2   Lack of knowledge

The seed arotders lack knowledge about pond management, stocking management and feeding
practices and they follow traditional practices. Due to low pond and stocking management, the quality
of the sourced seeds gets degraded.

                                                                                                            88

3.6.3   Seed quality

Since the arotdars have limited space and they deal with large amount of seeds sourced from different
sources, it is not possible for them to keep separate management for seeds from different sources. As
a result, they mix the seed from different sources thus degrading the quality of the seed reduces.

4. Fry Hawker
4.1 General Information

Fry hawkers act as intermediaries between seed producers and farmers. They buy fry and fingerling
from the nurseries and hatcheries and sell to the farmer’s doorstep. They carry the fry/fingerling in an
aluminum bowl (Patil) or plastic drum. The fry hawkers do the business on a seasonal basis. The
research team interviewed 14 fry hawkers in the FTF zone and ZOR to trace their role in the value
chain and connection to the fish farmers.

4.2 Sales

It was found from the interviews that each fry
hawker sold 4800-6000 kg (4.8-6 metric ton)
annually in 2018. From the fry hawker’s end, the
sale price of carp fry was BDT 300-350 per kg and
was BDT 200-250 per kg for Tilapia fry. The size of
the fry varies greatly according to the farmer’s
demand. Also, the price of the fry and fingerling
varies accordingly. The larger the size of the
fry/fingerling, the smaller the number of pieces per
kg, and thus lower the price. Price of the products
was mostly determined by their procurement cost       Figure 9.5: Annual Sales of the Fry Hawkers
from nurseries and hatcheries and demand from
the farmer’s end. It is reported that they can make BDT 10-40 profit per kg if the demand is
satisfactory.

4.3 Source of finance

Since the fry hawkers are marginal businessmen in the value chain, their access to
the finance is very limited. Most of the fry hawkers were found not to have their
own source of finance. They usually take loans from small village/business
cooperatives and MFIs, because these are easily available and accessible without
need for much paperwork. Loans are taken from the cooperatives or MFIs at the
beginning of the season of fish farming.
                                                                                      Figure 9.6: Source of
4.4 Network analysis                                                                     Finance for Fry




                                                                                                              89

Fry hawkers mostly act as an
intermediary. They were found not
to have many linkages with any
other market actors in the fish value
chain except the nursey/hatchery
(supplier) and farmers (customer).
Since many fry hawkers do this as a seasonal business, their relationships are not trust based the
nurseries and farmers.

From both ends, the fry hawkers had some credit and knowledge transactions. The fry hawkers stated
that they get some credit facilities from the nursery and hatchery usually limited in amount and only
if there is some personal relationship and trust. Usually they have to give more credit the farmers and
that it is common for 1 or 2 customers (farmers) to ask for credit and delay on repayment or not pay
at all.

The knowledge sharing among these actors is limited, mainly around production-related information
from the nurseries to the farmers through fry hawkers and information on market demand for
nurseries from the fry hawkers. The main mode of communication is the phone.

4.5 Market barriers

4.5.1   Lack of quality fingerling

It is reported that there is a lack of good quality fingerling from nurseries and hatcheries. The fry
hawkers complained that in many cases the procured fry die within half an hour of sourcing. High
mortality rate while transporting was found to be another problem for fry hawkers. As they practice
the traditional way of providing oxygen (rippling the water by hand), the fry tended to die more for
lack of oxygen and fluctuating temperature.

4.5.2   Knowledge gap

Lack of knowledge of farmers about pond preparation & feed use hampers their production. It is
reported by the fry hawkers that loss of fish production by farmers means the loss of their customers.

4.5.3   Lack of finance

Fry hawkers have lack of financial access. In peak season, they are not able to supply enough fry to
the farmers because they do not have enough money to buy the fry from the nursery in the first place.




                                                                                                          90

5. Feed company/mill

5.1 General information

Almost 100 commercial feed manufacturers are producing fish, livestock
and poultry feed in Bangladesh. 25 There are also a number of local feed
producers who produce and distribute fish feeds locally. Though poultry
feed is the major contributor in the feed market, the demand is
increasing for all of the feeds due to boost in the aquaculture, livestock
and poultry sectors. The yearly production of feeds is inadequate in
meeting the domestic demand, which is made by feed imports directly
from India and China. The fish feed industry is mainly concentrated
around Mymensingh and Khulna division, comprising almost 70-80
percent of fish farms in the country.26 March–October is the peak season
                                                                                        Figure 9.7: Feed Production in
for fish feed production as the market demand for feed is higher at this                         Bangladesh
time.25 Mostly, the farmers use sinking feeds more than the floating
ones.26

The research team interviewed 6 feed mills in FTF and ZOR zone. In general, they produce sinking and
floating feed for carp, Tilapia, Pangus, shrimp, prawn, singh, pabda and Koi mostly. The final customers
of the feed mills are fish farmers, nurseries and hatcheries. All the feed mills interviewed except
Spectra Hexa Feeds Ltd. have their main customer base inside FTF and ZOR zone. The PCF, North
Khulna and Niribili are more of local feed producers who cover their surrounding regions. The
distribution channel of Spectra Hexa Feeds Ltd. (Mega feed) covers most districts in Bangladesh as it
is one of the large feed companies in the country. The research team is defining Spectra Hexa Feeds
Ltd., Jashore Feed Ltd. and Victor Feeds Ltd. as feed companies (large in size) and the rest of the feed
producers as feed mills (small in size).

5.2 Procurement and production

The feed mills depend on the
domestic market as well as
international market for their input
sourcing. Most of the feed mills
surveyed source a major portion of
maize, and mustard oil cake (MOC),
de oiled rice bran (DOB), medicine,
soybean oil cake, dry fish, fish meal,
vitamin, minerals and pellet binder
from imported materials.


                                                 Figure 9.8: Market Coverage of Surveyed Feed Company/Mills
25 FAO, 2015, Aquaculture seed and feed production and management in Bangladesh- Status, issues and                      91
constraints
26      DATABD.CO,         2019,      Animal       Feed       Industries,       Light        Castle       Partners.
(https://databd.co/profiles/industries/profile-animal-feed)

Medicines are mostly imported from China and India, a very few from
Square and ACI limited. Maize and soybean oil cake are imported from
Brazil and Peru and mustard oil cake from India mostly. Some portion of
maize and all of the rice polish, rice bran, and wheat flour, salt are sourced
from the domestic market. Some raw materials are tested in their own or
government lab to control the quality of the feed. Overall the quality of
the feed ingredient is satisfactory. But at the beginning of the season
(April-May), the domestic maize is high in moisture which shortens the
expiration period of the feed. At this time, the feed mills try to source the
maize from the international market. The feed manufacturers reported
that large amount of tax is imposed on raw material which increases the
price of the product and therefore reduces their profit. Also, the delivery from port is delayed
sometimes. Due to these constraints, the manufacturers cannot get inputs timely which compels them
sometimes to produce feeds with inappropriate ratio of feed ingredients. This kind of production
practice decreases the product quality.

All of the feed mills surveyed (except Niribili Fish Feed Mill) produce both floating and sinking fish
feed. The Niribili Fish Feed Mill in Cox’s Bazar produce only sinking feed because it does not have the
capacity and investment to install new equipment for floating feed. In general, the demand for floating
feed is increasing day by day. It is found from the interviews that the demand for Tilapia feed is
decreasing because of the low price and demand of Tilapia fish in the market.

5.3 Sales and growth

The annual feed production and sales
vary among the feed mills. For Spectra
Hexa Feeds and Victor Feeds, the sales
figures are for FTF Zone only out of
their total sales in 2018. It is evident
from the figure that the Spectra Hexa
Feeds Ltd. (Mega feed) has the highest
value of sales through its 35 contracted
dealers in the FTF zone in 2018. In the
case of Jashore Feed Mill, the sales
amount is really low because fish feed
sale has a very small percentage out of
                                                  Figure 9.9: Annual Sales (2018) of Surveyed Feed Company/Mills
their total feed production. For all the
feed mills visited except the Niribili
feed mill in Cox’s Bazar, the fish feed production and demand are increasing year by year. The reason
for the Niribili feed mill to not to have this growth is the lack of working capital and growing popularity
of floating fish feed which are not produced in that mill. The larger feed companies are found to be
satisfied with their sale and expanding their production capacities. The smaller mills sell their own
product and also prepare feed for non-millers, and so they face a problem with sales (Niribili, PCF etc.).




                                                                                                                   92

5.4 Distribution network

The feed manufacturers distribute their product through
dealers in different regions who are directly connected
with the company marketing officers or technical
marketing officers. Retailers and sub-dealers are also in
this distribution channel who collect the product from
dealers and sell to final customers (farmers, nurseries
and hatcheries). The large feed companies evidently have
larger dealer base and small feed mills have a smaller
number of dealers. Products are delivered to dealers
through regional depot or directly from the production
unit.

For all the feed mills surveyed, the production unit goes for production after the marketing officers
place orders from the market (based on dealers’ information). The demand is forecasted weekly by
the marketing officers and they are also responsible for the unsold products. Demand for a particular
brand of fish feed largely depends on the quality of the product and promotional activities arranged
by the company/mill. The bigger companies (nationally known and have advance machinery) have
their own brands but the smaller millers like PCF; produces products with non-millers (who make feed
but they have no feed mill) brand.

As a promotional activity, the feed companies/mills provide training for the farmers with their
consultant and the farmers then reach the company consultant through dealers and marketing officers
as needed for advice. The companies also give rewards to bestselling dealers. Leaflets on use and
result of fish feeds are disseminated for mass promotion. In addition, advertisement is also done e.g.
public announcement. Large companies (e.g. Spectra Hexa) tries to keep the price constant the period
of time because the unstable price makes the customers buy other brands. They provide the technical
staff with test kits in order to provide support to the farmers on the technology of pond preparation,
feed uses and other pond
management activities. Few
feed companies have their
own testing laboratories for
quality control of the product
and ingredients; they also
support farmer for testing
pond       water      and      soil
conditions. There is apparently
a shortage of marketing
officers      of     the     feed
manufacturers obvious from
the       lack       of      field
communication with the
dealers and limited support to
the final customers. The small
feed mills cannot afford a large
                                              Figure 9.10: Promotional Activities of Feed Company/Mills
                                                                                                          93

labor pool and so have even fewer local representatives. For the large feed companies, there is also a
shortage of regional marketing officers as they cover larger areas.

5.5 Source of finance

The feed manufacturers mostly use their own capital and loan from formal financial institutions
(banks). Financial institutions provide two types of credit- (a) long-term for factory establishment and
(b) Cash Credit (CC) loan for operations. There is a common issue of bureaucratic and paperwork
difficulties in getting loans from banks. Manufacturers report that in many cases Bank personnel need
to be bribed or alternatively use politically powerful bodies to get the loan. Sometimes the machinery
is purchased on credit and installment facilities from suppliers. Five out of the six feed manufacturers
interviewed reported improved financial flow in current year than the previous years.

5.6 Network analysis

At the beginning of the year, the feed manufacturers collect the samples and price rate from the
suppliers and accordingly select the better quality inputs at an affordable price. The relationship is
congenial and trust-based. The price of inputs is the most important factor in determining the feed
price.




                              Figure 9.11: Information Flow among Market Actors

Usually one dealer can deal products of multiple companies, whoever in the case of large companies
like Mega, the dealer is not allowed to sell other company products. Mega feels that if this is allowed
then the dealers will also try sell other low-quality feeds because of the high commission which
hampers the company’s profit. Some local feed mills produce feed and use the same packaging as few
large branded feed companies like Mega, Quality etc. basically, they are selling low quality feed with
branded name which is harmful for the company image and brand and thus they have strict
requirements for their dealers.

The feed manufacturers give small credit to the dealers. In most of the cases the large companies give
credit as a percentage of their procurement from the companies. There have been concerns of non-
repayment which is why the companies are strict about credit. The local small feed mills however
have to provide credit to the dealers whenever arotder to maintain business relationship and ensure
their product is sold. From the dealer’s perspective, they have to give credit to its customers (farmers
mostly) to a large extent because most of the customers are marginal or small farmers who cannot
afford commercial feed and then get paid after the farmer’s sell their harvest which is a very common

                                                                                                           94

practice in Bangladesh. For this reason, dealers have expressed that they too need to get more credit
from the feed manufacturers to minimize their risk of non-repayment.

Feed manufacturers also provide production related information and feed use support to the farmers
through their own consultants connected through the dealers. Every kind of field relation of the
manufacturers in the market is handled by the marketing officers. In feed market, the manufacturers
set the price and modalities of transaction between them and the dealers.

5.7 Market barriers

5.7.1   Malpractice & corruption

Some local mills produce low quality feeds while copying the packaging and branding of popular feed
producers and introduce them into the market through dishonest dealers which causes the farmers
to lose trust about a good brand. It is reported that business fell by 5 percent for Mega and by 35
percent for Quality because of such illegal practice by other companies. The feed manufacturers
reported that loyal and efficient dealers are hard to find. Dealers are necessary resources for the
companies/mills for efficient distribution and marketing system.

5.7.2   Problems in input sourcing

There is a large amount of tax imposed on ingredients (fish meal protein-2.5 percent, soybean cake-5
percent (Argentina) and corn- 3-4 percent) which increases the product prices. High price reduces the
demand in the market very fast because most of the fish farmers in this country are small and have
low access to finance. Even if the production cost rises, the small feed mills cannot raise the price
because of the risk of losing customers. There is also a lack of raw material supply in the peak season
which hampers the quality of the product. Sometimes lack of raw materials causes the manufacturers
to alter the appropriate ratio of the ingredients in the feed product which degrades the quality of the
feed. Sometimes the imported ingredients get damaged while waiting to be released from the port.

5.7.3   Lack of testing facility

In most of the feed mills, there is lack of testing lab or facilities. Also, there is no regulation for batch-
wise testing from the authorities. The test results are so delayed that it is not convenient for the
producers to wait that long.

5.7.4   Lack of monitoring & regulation

Generally, the market is controlled by the powerful local people which hinders natural flow. Also,
there is lack regulatory committee or government body for feed-producing commercial organizations.

5.7.5   Delayed transportation

The feed manufacturers reported that the carrying cost is high for the raw materials. Also, sometimes
the transportation of raw materials procured from domestic market is delayed.

5.7.6   Farmer’s preference



                                                                                                                 95

Sometimes the fishes smell foul due to poor feed quality and pond management. But the farmers
perceive it as the result of feed use which discourages them in using commercial feed. Also, because
of the traditional practices, farmers prefer homemade feed or household scraps instead of spending
money on commercial feed.

In addition to these constraints, there is problem with the interrupted supply of electricity which
forces the mill to stop and delay production. For feed production, skilled manpower is not readily
available in the labor market.




                                                                                                       96

6. Medicine company

6.1 General information

There are various types of chemicals and drugs used in health management of aquatic animals, pond
preparation, soil and water management, aquatic productivity, feed formulation, manipulation of
reproduction, growth promotion processing and in value-added products.27 Also, there are different
kinds of anti-biotic drugs used for the treatment of diseased fish. But, in general, there are no
authorized and specific medicine for fish in Bangladesh. The available products are basically water
treatment chemicals, minerals, feed nutrients and for fish seed production.

To trace the aqua medicine companies in the market, the research team interviewed two medicine
companies- Eon Agro Industries Ltd and Green Dale Bangladesh Ltd. EON aquaculture ventures started
in 2002 with R&D based project; now working in different areas like pond water quality management,
aquatic health and diseases management, nutrition, stress management and project management.
They first started in Khulna and Satkhira. Green Dale Bangladesh Ltd started as a Bangladeshi company
in 2016. In the aquaculture sector, they are marketing medicine as well as feeds.

6.2 Procurement and production

The medicine companies mostly rely on import for
their input sourcing. Typically, these companies do
not manufacture much medicine in their own
facility. They import and repackage with their own
label. EON’s input sourcing is based on 80 percent
import and 20 percent own manufacture while Figure 9.12: Input Sourcing of the Medicine Companies
Green Dale depends wholly on import from the
mostly UK. Eon imports medicine & chemicals from Vietnam, Thailand and India (Assam). Generally,
the medicine companies select the medicine from a fair or exporter’s website and orders it. A major
portion of their chemicals and medicine are used in pesticide production. The medicine that is
imported from foreign countries mainly comes through Chattogram port. Then after having a test
report of the medicines, these are taken by the company for another product details test following
which the medicines are transferred to the warehouse for further processing. Sometimes the medicine
is transferred to the repackaging plant where they are distributed again. The warehouse for Eon is in
Gazipur and for Green Dale is in Sirajganj.

6.3 Sales

In 2018, EON sold medicines and chemicals worth BDT 480 million including aqua medicine and others.
In 2019, their target is BDT 620 million of which 85 percent has already been achieved. In the case of
Green Dale, the aqua medicine production for FTF zone only is worth of BDT 2.4 million.




27 Rahman, M. Z., Khatun, A., Kholil, M. I. & Hossain, M. M. (2017) Aqua drugs and chemicals used in fish farms   97
of Comilla regions, Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies, 5(6), 2462-2473

6.4 Distribution network

The product distribution channel of the medicine companies is similar to the feed companies. They
distribute through regional dealers who are connected to the marketing officers of the companies.
There are 350 sales officers and 25 technical officers in total in Eon. In the case of Green Dale, there
are 4 technical marketing officers (TMO) in FTF zone (Bhola, Barisal, Patuakhali, Gopalgonj and
Bagerhat). Under every TMO, there are 15-25 dealers. The medicine is distributed from their
warehouses to the dealers. As part of promotional activities, the medicine companies arrange
seminar, group discussion, spot discussion, dealer training, DOF training, private consultant, product
demonstration, meeting with farmers, annual sales meeting, district/sub-district level meeting,
dealers meeting and feed officer level meeting.

6.5 Network analysis

The modality of the business between medicine companies and dealers is similar to the feed
companies. In a similar fashion, they communicate with dealers through sales officers and provide
support to the final customers (farmers) through technical marketing officers. The transaction
between dealers and medicines companies is mostly in cash and few in credit. The companies face a




                                   Figure 9.13: Information Flow among Actors

parallel problem of disloyal dealers in the distribution system like the feed companies. The products
are generally tested by BFRI (Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute) before getting NOC (No
Objection Certificate) from DoF. Generally, after getting application for NOC for new product, DoF
send the samples to BFRI for lab and field test. After getting clearance from BFRI, DoF issue NOC for
the product. DoF is the regulatory authority for fisheries but the companies have to take a license on
medicine and drug from “veterinary drug regulatory wing” of DLS (Department of Livestock Services).

6.6 Market Barriers

6.6.1   NOC

The medicine companies are required to get NOC from DoF for the medicines and chemicals they
procure and manufacture. It is reported that sometimes the officials of DoF do not understand the
medicine category properly. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge on part of the DoF officer on the
performance of the product. The companies stated that there is extra tax imposition on the products,
simply because the related authority cannot differentiate between the categories of the medicines
and its uses. Also, there is a lot of paperwork-related to hassles. It is evident that if the hassle of papers

                                                                                                                 98

to get NOC and import tax can be reduced the price of the product could be 30-40 percent less than
that of present price. Another problem is that there is no separate government entity to handle this
issue. The companies have to communicate with different wings of the government like DoF and DLS.
Not having the NOC creates another problem of increased cost. For example, Green Dales does not
have any “No Objection Certificate”, as a result, sometimes they have to pay double for the import
medicines, chemicals, feed additives, etc.

6.6.2   Knowledge gap

Lack of knowledge is a very common problem in the aqua medicine market as well as the feed market.
The DoF personnel do not have exact knowledge of the use of many aqua medicines. As a result, in
many cases, they cannot act reasonably. Knowledge gap also exists in the market with dealers.
Sometimes, they add extra medicine while selling to farmers which causes the farmers to spend more
money. Furthermore, they suggest the farmers to use the medicine more than the suitable amount
which hampers the pond quality and fish production in many cases.

6.6.3   Illegal products

Similar to the fish feed market, there are some unregistered companies introducing unauthorized
products in the aqua medicine market with similar packaging of popular brands. Like feed companies,
the medicine companies face the same problem

7. Dealer & retailer

7.1 General information

Dealers and retailers are a significant part of the distribution
channel of fish feed companies/mills and aqua medicine
companies and fish value chain as a whole. They are the
intermediaries between the producer of the feed/medicine and
final customers (farmers). The research team interviewed 19
dealers and 5 retailers (24 in total). Most of the dealers and
retailers were found to sell both fish feed and medicine. In 2018,
it was evident that 10 out of 24 dealers and retailers sold Tilapia
feed mostly and 14 out of 24 dealers and retailers sold carp feed
                                                                    Figure 9.14: Sales of Dealers & Retailers
mostly.

7.2 Transaction modality

The dealers were found to procure feed and medicine from manufacturing companies based on cash
transactions. Only 6 out of 24 dealer and retailers interviewed reported that they fish feed was
procured on credit only from some of the local feed mills or the smaller companies in 2018. Mostly,
large companies like Mega have stopped giving credit facilities because of the risk of non-repayment.
But small feed companies or mills usually allow sale on credit since this is a way to promote and expand
the business.




                                                                                                                99

The dealers were found to provide products sometimes on credit to
retailers and the final customers (farmers, hatchery, and nursery
owners). In 2018, 5 out of 24 dealers and retailers were found to sell
products based on cash transaction.

Dealers and retailers sell feed on credit only to their long-term and
loyal customers with good repayment record, and this seemed to be
considerable since 19 out of 24 dealers and retailers reported that they
sold feeds mostly on credit in 2018. It was also found through the
interviews that the grassroots level dealers and retailers give more
credit than district level large dealers. At the upazila and union level,
small farmers demand credit mostly because it is difficult for them to
pay for the feed and medicine in advance. Some farmers may be able
to pay partially and the rest intermittently after harvest of the fish e.g.
after a week or a month or even after harvesting the fish. Furthermore,
the dealers and retailers tend to sell more on credit to larger farmers
who purchase in bulk amount. Large fish farmers, large nurseries and
                                                                              Figure 9.15: Modality of Purchase
hatcheries were found to purchase feed in wholesale amount.
                                                                                           & Sales

Non-payment of credit is the major problem identified by the feed
dealers and retailers. The reasons being lack of own capital or limited access of
fish farmers to financial services, loss of fish harvest due to natural disaster or
inefficiency in production practices, and also poor performance from fish
(especially the feeds from local feed mills that do not meet required ingredient
content). Even loyal customers sometimes had ended up not paying up their dues
to the dealers/ retailers in 2018.

It was found that every dealer and retailer that we interviewed, on an average 2-         Figure 9.16: Unpaid
5 percent of the credit amount that they had lent to their customers in 2018 has                 Credit
remained unpaid by the point of data collection (May 2019).

7.3 Source of finance

The dealers and retailers access banks, business cooperatives and MFIs in addition to their own source
of capital. In most cases, they accessed more than one source at a time. Everyone interviewed have
their own source of finance which is usually not adequate for the business. The major source of finance
is a loan from the government or private banks because it is a large amount, even if the interest rate
is high for bank loans. 18 out of 24 dealers and retailers were found to take CC (Cash Credit) loan from
the government banks which they use mainly for procurement of product.




                                                                                                                  100

There were a few dealers and retailers who took a loan from business
cooperatives. The main reason for this that it is easy to access
cooperatives whenever needed without much paperwork. 3 out of 24
dealers and retailers reported that they took a loan from business
cooperatives in 2018. Only one retailer reported that he took a loan from
MFIs (Micro Finance Institutions) because suddenly he required a small
amount of cash for a short period of time.

7.4 Network analysis

Dealers and retailers do not have their own promotional activities. Feed
and medicine companies arrange various kinds of promotional activities
like yard meetings and providing technical support for their products to
increase their sales where the dealers and retailers participate and act
as a bridge between the farmers and the manufacturing companies. In
addition to the commission, the companies arrange an annual meeting
and provide reward based on best sales

Only a few dealers arrange yard meeting on their own to increase their
sale. In addition, they reported that they provide advice on the use of
feed and medicine to their customers, since the farmers are not aware
about which product to use and how.                                           Figure 9.17: Source of Finance


This relation was found to be the same with nurseries and hatcheries. The dealers report that
hatcheries seek help from them also to find and link with potential customers (farmers).

7.5 Market barriers

7.5.1   Illegal products



                                                                                                               101

The research team found that there are unregistered/ unmonitored companies and feed mills that
produce feeds that do not have all the necessary food ingredients for fish production (even have
harmful pathogens). These are made by some local feed mills who market these dishonestly in with
packaging and branding of the well-known companies. There are similarly some dishonest dealers who
try to promote sales of these adulterated products with their customers since the mills give these
dealers flexible long-term credit facilities with higher profit margin. Such practices affect the image of
the good quality branded feeds, the companies.

7.5.2   Lack of credit

As already mentioned, most of the large feed and medicine companies do not provide credit facilities
to dealers. Dealers are therefore forced to take loans to procure feed and medicine even with high
interest rate. They dealers expressed that if the large feed companies allowed some credit on the
procurement, they would not have to give the high interest rates to the banks and also be able to
trade more goods. Because of having limited finance, they can only buy small amounts of feed and
medicine, another reason for many of the dealers to be interested in selling low quality feed from local
feed mills giving credit with higher profit margins.

7.5.3   Lack of feed supply in peak season

The dealers and retailers report a shortage of feed supply from the companies in the peak season. In
2018, during the peak season in 2018, their orders were delivered 3-7 days later than the usual product
delivery time which decreased their sales and caused dissatisfaction among their customers.
Furthermore added to this, the companies increase the feed price during this same time. Low supply
together with price hike is discouraging for the fish farmers who then often switch to buying other
low-quality low-priced product brands.

7.5.4   Storage and warehouse facilities

Expiration date of fish feeds usually end within a few months after they are purchased and therefore,
it is not possible for dealers and retailers to make a large inventory and utilize the stock in the peak
sales season when the demand is high, and supply is not regular. Also, most of the dealers and retailers
have no storage or warehouse facilities to store the products even for a short period of time.

7.5.5   Renewing license

The interviewed dealers complained that face corruption and bribery when renewing their licenses.
In cases of medicine dealers, the harassment was more because of the strict laws on medicine used in
aquaculture. The respondents stated that there were also lack knowledge among regulatory actors
regarding the laws and acts on medicine use.




                                                                                                             102

8. Local Extension Agent for Fisheries (LEAF)

8.1 General information

In 2006, DoF LEAF program under the extension management along with other agencies and partners
to support the small-scale farmers through advice, facilitation awareness raising and technology
transfer about fish culture. 28 Under the National Agricultural Technology Program (NATP), Farmer’s
Information and Advice Center (FIAC) was launched in 270 upazillas of 57 districts. 29 Under this
program many LEAF members were appointed as Union Extension Facilitation Team (UEFT) along with
other agencies, partners and NGOs. 30

In FTF zone, in almost every upazila, there are LEAF members appointed by DoF. In most cases, LEAF
members were selected based their on-going involvement in aquaculture activities. Many farmers,
hatchery or nursery owners, feed or medicine dealer and retailers and local practitioners were
considered as LEAF members. All the selected LEAF members participated in knowledge sharing
sessions and workshops on fish culture and disease management. The research team interviewed 5
LEAF members in the Feed the Future zone.

The LEAF members were given with tool kit box including instruments for testing pond soil, water pH,
and oxygen level in water by DoF. Beside these the LEAF members under the NATP project were given
tab with some videos about the pond, stocking and disease management. Some of the LEAF members
were given bicycle for visiting farms. DoF provides a monthly honorarium of BDT 2000 for the service.
Additionally, the LEAF members get some financial incentives by charge fees for the testing facilities
used by the farmers.

8.2 Activities and services of LEAF

The LEAF members are generally
connected with the small-scale farmers
                                                         Testing facilities (water, soil)
and also acquainted with the large
farmers and hatcheries are also                             Provide information about pond
acquainted with the LEAF members but
                                                            management
only a few nurseries connect with them       LEAF           Advice fish stocking & health care
for consultation. From the interviews it
was found that farmers did not consult                   Suggest medication preventing disease
much with the LEAF members and from
                                                   Figure 9.19: Services provided by LEAF members
interviews with farmers it was found that
most farmers are not aware of the LEAF services and activities. Only few of the farmers who had
frequent iteration with LEAF members new about LEAF. LEAF members are usually busy with other
livelihoods which is why they probably do not provide as extensive a support to the farmers in their
area as they were expected to.


28 Aquaculture Extension Sub-strategy (                                                                          103

30 http://www.natp2dae.gov.bd/index.php/farmers-information-and-advice-center-fiac/

Each LEAF member is supposed to connect to and consult with 15-20 fish farmers about their problems
every month. They would support in testing pond soil, water pH, oxygen level in water and other
problems. When the LEAF members meet with new fish farmers, they share the knowledge on pond
preparation, pond management the appropriate techniques of fish stocking in the pond, knowledge
on regular health monitoring system and health monitoring parameters. Farmers only contact a LEAF
member when they observe any disease occurrence or sudden death of the stocked fish. The LEAF
members test the quality of the pond water and try to identify the cause of the problem observed and
then give suggestion to solve the problem. When they fail to do solve the fish farmer’s problem, they
contact the nearby fisheries extension officers.

DoF appointed LEAF members under the extension management program to formulate Common
Interest Group (CIG) cooperatives with fish farmer membership. LEAF members establish cooperative
groups with 15-20 fish farmers as members. Every month BDT 50 are collected from each member as
savings and deposited in a bank savings account. Every month they arrange monthly meeting to
discuss about problems related to fish culture. LEAF members facilitate the CIG members to get loan
for fish culture from the cooperative fund. Non-CIG members also take advice form the LEAF
members.

From the observation by the research team and it was found from the interview that, the activities
and services of LEAF was very limited in the study area, found only in Jashore (Kashobpur) and in some
areas LEAF members only gave information. The LEAF members were not motivated since they got
limited financial incentives.

8.3 Network analysis

The network and linkage of the LEAF is linear as the members just receive training from DoF and other
NGOs and provide information and services mainly for small scale farmers.

Due to the limited knowledge about LEAF members and their services, most fish farmers and others
like hatcheries do not avail of this service.

8.4 Market barriers and problems they face

8.4.1   Lack of finance

The honorarium of the LEAF members is very limited and not an important earning source. They have
to visit many fish farmers monthly which involves lots of physical activities and with the limited
honorarium it is demotivating.

8.4.2   Lack of technology support

The equipment received by the LEAF are few and there is little scope to repair and maintain damaged
equipment, most also being outdated and therefore not appropriate in meeting farmer’s needs.

8.4.3   Lack of knowledge

Though the LEAF members have participated in different training programs and workshops arranged
by DoF and development agencies or NGOs, the knowledge is not sufficient to support and mitigate


                                                                                                         104

the problems faced by farmers. Most of the cases they cannot identify the problems or disease and
have to wait for the response from the DoF officials.

8.4.4   Lack of monitoring

Though there are many trained LEAF members appointed in different areas by DoF and are given
honorarium monthly, but most of the LEAF members are not functional in the field. They are engaged
in other activities and not working according to the instruction given by DoF.

8.4.5   Lack of promotion

As a part of extension program, DoF has launch the LEAF service but due to limited promotional
activities in most of the areas farmers do not know about the service.




                                                                                                     105

9. CPG Processor

9.1 General information

The research team found that there are different types of hormone practice among the hatcheries.
Many hatchery practitioners use synthetic hormones for breeding, the source of which are some
importer companies or large medicine companies importing from China and other countries. Some
hatcheries avoid the synthetic hormones as they consider it unreliable. Other hatchery operators
collect raw pituitary grand of carp fishes from the local market and reserve the raw pituitary glands in
alcohol, later they use these in raw form. Again a few hatchery operators use processed dry pituitary
glands imported from India through local importing companies or directly from the Carp Pituitary
Gland (CPG) processor companies.

The number of CPG processors in Bangladesh are few. The research team has visited one CPG
processor company, Bangladesh United Agro Fisheries in Jashore. The main product of the
manufacturer is the pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands. They collect the raw carp pituitary glands
from different sources and process these in the laboratory to produce pure acetone dried carp
pituitary glands. The total employee of the company is around 50 persons.

9.2 Procurement Information

To produce pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands, raw carp
pituitary glands and acetone are the major inputs. The raw carp
pituitary glands are collected in Bangladesh and India from the
fishmongers in the local market and when social ceremonies
are held. In Bangladesh, 170 fish cutters are connected with the
company through 6 collection agents. Similarly, 24 fish cutters
are connected with the company through 5 collection agents in
India. The company collects the excised glands from India           Figure 9.20: Grading of the glands
through 2 suppliers. The collection of raw glands is higher in
winter compared to other seasons as there are more wedding ceremonies in winter. The average price
an A grade gland is BDT 3 per piece. The glands sourced are not enough as the market linkage is poor
in the supply chain.

The quality of the glands depends on the size of the fish. The glands sourced from the market are
found in 3 grades based on the weight and size. The A-grade glands are found in fishes more than 2-3
kg and the quality decreases as the size the of the fish decreases. B-grade glands are found commonly
in the local market.

The company imports major portion of the acetone from outside the country and sometimes they
have to source it from local market. The quality of acetone is not satisfactory all the time. To maintain
the quality of the glands 100 percent pure acetone is required but most of the time the quality of the
acetone is 60-70 percent.

The pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands are produced in a controlled environment to ensure the
quality and avoid the fungal attack. The process is carried out through 6 steps shown in the diagram
below.

                                                                                                            106

                               Figure 9.21: Process flow of carp pituitary glands

9.3 Production and sales information

After processing the raw pituitary, these are stored on the laboratory. The maximum production
capacity of the company is 10 kg per year. In 2018 total production of the company was 6 kg. In spite
of having capacity the company cannot reach maximum production because the supply of raw glands
is small. Another reason for avoiding maximum production in 2018 was that majority hatchery
practitioners were increasingly depending on synthetic hormones glands and only a few know about
the availability of pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands in the country.

Based on the grading of the glands the company has 3 package sizes of small, medium and large. For
packaging sealed glass bottle are used. The price of pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands in 2018
was BDT 3000-4000 per gram in Bangladesh. In the international market, the price was USD 90-95.
The company also exported 700 gm of the gland to in different countries and also sent 40 gm of dried
glands to Japan University free of cost for testing the quality and to develop a customer relationship
in Japan. Beside this the company has sent free samples of their product to 22 countries to promote
their product in the international market.

9.4 Product distribution network and market promotion

The company has their own website for product promotion and sales and also tagged with different
online trading platform like Alibaba to advertise the product national and international market. The
product is distributed to 14 countries through these platforms. To sell within the country, the company
has 2 dealers in Jashore and customers of 70-80 hatcheries across the country through the dealers.

To demonstrate that the product is of good quality to their online or foreign customers the company
has verified their product quality through third-party verification service provider Within the country
the company participates in the DoF programs and also arrange information sharing session with the
hatchery owners and large farmers to promote the use of pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands..

9.5 Source of finance

The company is run with the owner’s own investment. According to the owner, the company can fulfill
the increasing demand up to a certain level. The operational cost for promotional activities is high and
support from development organizations or NGOs are expected by the company owner. The company
owner prefers not to take loan because of the hassle involved.

9.6 Network analysis

With regards to backward linkage to the input suppliers, the CPG processor communicates with
fishmongers through collection agents and the Indian supply is obtained through 2 suppliers linked
collection agents who are further connected to the fishmongers. To create this supply chain the
company has trained a number of butchers on how to collect and handle the raw glands. The fish
butchers – collection agent have cash-based transaction.
                                                                                                           107

The company makes advance payment to the suppliers and other inputs and machineries are sourced
from the local market. The major problem is the sourcing of the raw glands, since a limited number of
fishmongers are connected to the supply chain. . With regards to forward linkage with the output
market, the CPG processor sells the product to the hatchery practitioners through dealers in the
domestic market and to the international market through online trading platform as already
mentioned above.

9.7 Market barriers and problems they face

9.7.1   Source of raw pituitary glands

The source of pituitary glands is very limited.

9.7.2   Lack of information

Majority of the fish butchers do not have sound knowledge and training about handling the raw glands
as a result many glands are damaged while collecting.

9.7.3   Dependency on synthetic hormone

Majority of the hatchery practitioners are dependent on the synthetic hormones and do not know
about the side effects. They are not confident about changing the hormone practice and customers
for pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands is limited in Bangladesh.

9.7.4   Lack of finance

To operate training programs and the promotional activities, a well-defined financial flow is required.
But the paper work and installment payments are considered a hassle by the company owner, so the
training programs are arranged with limited finance.

9.7.5   Quality of acetone

To process good quality pure acetone dried carp pituitary glands, the quality of the acetone needs to
be optimum, however the quality of the acetone is always not satisfactory as a result the quality of
the dried glands decreases.

9.7.6   Hatchery practitioners’ perception

Some hatchery practitioners use acetone dried carp pituitary glands but do not get expected results
due to low brood quality and instead of considering all limiting factors especially poor fry or poor
brood quality, farmers tend to blame the quality of the acetone dried carp pituitary glands.




                                                                                                          108

10. Equipment manufacturer

10.1 General information

As the fish industry grows both in production, technology used, marketing etc. there are continuous
studies to identify scope of improvements and innovations. As such there are some companies who
manufacture and import equipment used in aquaculture. The research team has interviewed one
equipment manufacturer company in Jashore.

The company manufacture solar based equipment used in aquaculture based on their own expertise
and own design. They are trying to patent their machines but failed to do so since there are not enough
experts in this sector. They have a set of machines for sales. They are:

     ✓ Fish egg shaking machine
     ✓ Underwater gas removing machine
     ✓ Solar fish feed production machine
     ✓ Solar water recycling and purifying system for fish hatchery
     ✓ Solar water pumping system
They have 10 Full time employees and 30 part time employees and have plans of hiring student from
polytechnic institute. They have their own technical manpower to produce these machines and
currently focusing on improving technical skills of their workers so that they can produce high quality
machines. The company finances the business from their own funds and have not taken any loans so
far.

10.2 Sales information

The company sold three solar pump machines in 2018. As the awareness among the farmers and other
actors is growing about such technology, the practice of using different machineries is gradually
increasing. The company is selling these machines to the farmers at a lower price than other
companies to create a brand value and as a promotional strategy. All the products are made according
to buyer’s requirement. Farmers, hatcheries and nurseries are still managing their production with
traditional knowledge. Due to lack of public awareness about improved technology practice the sales.
Most of the farmers and other actors do not know machines which can help increase their production
and reduce the operational costs.

Promotional activities by the company include seminar, TV shows, newspaper advertisement,
providing leaflet to the dealers and retailers. Also, they are trying to collaborate with development
sector organizations to reach out to farmers.

10.3 Network analysis

The company source their necessary inputs from raw material suppliers and the main buyers of the
company are farmers, hatcheries and nurseries. The company connect with the buyers through
promotional activities. Interested buyers place order with their specific requirement and the company
supply the machines. The market linkage is very limited and most of the farmers are not aware of the
technology as a result, the sales is low.



                                                                                                          109

10.4 Market barriers and problems they face

10.4.1 Weak market linkage

Due to prevailing traditional practice in aquaculture and lack of awareness about improved
technologies the demand of the machines is low at this moment.

10.4.2 Lack of skilled labor

The manufacture of machines requires sophisticated skill and adequate knowledge base, however
most of the employees are not skilled enough.

10.4.3 Technical problem

The production modality of the hatcheries varies from one another based on area and practice. To
design customized machines for each buyer is costly and time worthy. Also implementing generalized
machines for all buyer will not be effective.

10.4.4 Patent Issue

The company is trying to make a patent of their innovative machine but failed to do so since there are
not enough experts in this sector to make the patent of a new instrument.




                                                                                                         110

11. Output market

11.1 General information

To understand the flow of farmed fish in the output market, the research team interviewed various
output actors in the fish value chain of carp and Tilapia in the ZOI and ZOR. The surveyed output actors
are foria, arotder, commission agent, wholesaler, ice factory, fish trader’s association, small retailer,
digital platform and processor.

11.2 Network analysis

Among other output level actors, foria and arotder are directly linked to the fish producers (farmers).
The fish farmers do not sell all of their fish all at once. They contact the forias before harvesting who
buys fish from farmer’s doorstep and sells to arot or wholesaler. Sometimes forias buy fish stock of a
pond in advance and harvest on their own. Arotder provides a market place for fish auction in
exchange for a commission on sales. In arots, both foria and farmer sell fish to the wholesalers.
Another actor, the commission agent links arotder to a wholesaler in exchange of a commission. Arots
store a small amount of fish in the freezer (if any) or with ice blocks procured from ice mills. They sell
the fish to the wholesaler as soon as possible. There is a lack of storage facilities in the arots and it
would be a lot more profitable for them if the arotdars could store the fish in the freezer in peak
season since. Fish supply is not regular and when there are no fish, arotders have no business. The
research team found in Bagerhat that few arotders provide fish fry/fingerling to the small farmers with
the condition of selling the fish in their arots after harvesting.




                             Figure 9.22: Market Linkage among Output Actors




                             Figure 9.23: Market Linkage among Output Actors




                                                                                                             111

The Wholesalers are a major part of the output market and some small retailers (local) buy fish from
the arots too. The wholesalers transport the fish from the local level to the large city markets (like
Dhaka) and during transportation time the fish quality degrades usually because of the lack of icing or
freezer facilities. Also, delay on the road is a very common issue in Bangladesh due to traffic
congestion, political unrest, ferry, etc. Fish processors who usually export their products also collect
the fish from a wholesaler for processing.

Wholesalers provide the fishes to the supermarkets (e.g. Swapno, Agora) and small retailers. Digital
platforms (e.g. Chal Dal) also procure the fish from wholesalers and provide directly to the final
consumers through their website or Facebook page. This is a comparatively new mode of fish business.

11.3 Market barriers

11.3.1 Quality degradation while transportation

Since fish is a perishable product, the quality degrades very quickly while being transported from
producer to the final consumer. Fish quality mostly degrades during long travel transportation where
many constraints are faced: ferry, police barricade, traffic jam delaying the whole process. With the
proper freezing facility, there would be less degradation of the products. But, in most cases, the
wholesalers were found to transport the fish in ice on open trucks.

11.3.2 Quality degradation in Arots

The environment and hygiene in the arots is not satisfactory. Also, they do not have adequate freezing
facilities and ice supply, reducing fish quality.

11.3.3 Live fish

There is a high demand for live fish in the market. Consumers prefer live fish more than the iced one,
but reaching the live fish from the fish farm to consumer’s doorstep is a major challenge since proper
transportation of live fish is difficult. There is no established system to transport the live fish from one
corner of the country to another.

11.3.4 Preservation knowledge

It is evident that there is a lack of sufficient knowledge of preservation (e.g. chill kill) at the farmer’s
level. The most common practice for the farmers is to sell the fish immediately after harvesting.
Sometimes they sell all the fish in a pond altogether before harvesting to the foria. Thus, any kind of
preservation technique is not practiced at the farmer’s end. Most of the farmers have limited
knowledge of preservation methods. If the fish could be preserved or iced immediate after harvesting,
the quality degradation can be prevented.

11.3.5 Misconception

There are some misconception and misinformation from the electronic media and social media that
the taste and vitamin properties of fish deteriorates if commercial feeds are used which discourages
consumers to buy cultured fish.

                  Fish farmers will be sensitized on product quality requirements and get access
                  to the market, improve product quality, and receive a better price that farmers
                  earn more by selling high- quality products, thereby achieving increased market
                  access. Besides that, the company may find it risky to source fish from an area
                  in ZOI even though product quality is appropriate. In such case, BANA may
                  facilitate the creation of procurement channel in those areas thereby giving
