Executive Summary

Feed the Future Bangladesh Aquaculture and Nutrition Activity targets to achieve inclusive
aquaculture sector growth through a market systems approach. Significant importance is thus given
on market resource mapping using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Starting from December,
2018 to September’ 2019 an extensive spatial survey has been conducted across the Feed the Future
Zone of Influence (ZOI) and Zone of Resilience (ZOR) to locate all the aquaculture market actors.

The main objective of this market resource mapping exercise was to identify potential gaps in input
supply or market services and provide a key decision and policy tool for management of the Activity
and the aquaculture sector in the coverage areas. Linked to GIS maps this spatial database shall
provide near real-time spatial information on supplier/market actor’s location and product
description. In total 23 districts, 150 Upazillas, 99 Paurashavas and 1332 unions have been visited
under this GIS resource mapping activity. Basic information along with spatial data for every single
market actors across the surveyed region has been captured. After series of data checking and
validation stage collected data has been uploaded in server. This census has collected detailed
information for 7,414 markets including fish and without fish, 153 feed mills, 339 hatcheries and
18,324 nurseries in the survey site.

A spatial variation on market system between different areas within the ZOI and ZOR has also been
analyzed. This report is divided into two sections; first section summarizes the census information
along with the background document, methodology, finding, analysis, field challenges and learnings.
Second section is added to demonstrate the application of GIS dataset in analyzing and overlaying
data by diversified ways to run different analytical functions that could contribute to a faster and more
efficient decision making process. Some potential applicability of GIS dataset as a supportive tool for
making investment plan, market gap analysis, route plan, market research etc. has been showcased in
section two to encourage stakeholders for integrating GIS in their decision support system. Finally, a
list of way forwards are suggested for its scalability and ability to reach to a wider audience.

             Section One: Field Survey of Aquaculture Resource Mapping

        1.1 Background

Feed the Future Bangladesh Aquaculture and Nutrition Activity is built on the achievements of the six-
year Aquaculture for Income and Nutrition (AIN) project, which ended in 2017. Ideologically the
Activity is a shift from AIN’s direct delivery approach to inclusive market-focused, private sector led
system that ensures the sustainability of aquaculture’s contribution to income and nutrition system
in a gender inclusive manner. This five-year (2018–2023) activity aims to take a market system
approach by designing and implementing interventions that address the underlying causes of poor
market functioning, including lack of trust between market actors, lack of information on market
signals and limits on market access placed by actors. The Activity target private sector firms to find out
specific windows of opportunity where it can contribute for improved income and nutrition. The
private firms have potentially been targeted to a) facilitate widespread adoption of new technologies,
b) provide key business support services and c) guide key sector stakeholders in policy adaptation for
improved aquaculture sector competitiveness. This Activity aims to a) engage with all key aquaculture
market system actors’ including private sector, government, universities, and civil society
organizations and b) re-align functions with the players best-positioned to advance continued
aquaculture transformation that is inclusive of disadvantaged groups, including women and youth
(aged 15-29 years old).
The goal of the Activity is to achieve inclusive aquaculture sector growth through a market systems
approach that means stimulating investment by the private sector and organizations to achieve the
objectives with a focus on
sustainability. The specific
objective of the Activity
has been identified as
increased productivity of
aquaculture        systems,
strengthened aquaculture
market systems, with
special attention paid to
expanding opportunities
for women and youth and
increased awareness and
adoption of nutrition-
related           behavior,
specifically focusing on
women and youth.
The geographic coverage
of    this     Geographic
Information System (GIS)
study is the Feed the
Future (FTF) ZOI, covering
twenty-one       southern                                  Figure 1 Area coverage

                                                                                                 Page | 4

districts in Barisal Division (Barisal, Bhola, Jhalokati, Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali), Dhaka Division
(Faridpur, Gopalganj, Madaripur, Rajbari, Shariatpur), and Khulna Division (Jashore, Jhenaidah,
Magura, Narail, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira, Chuadanga, Meherpur, Kushtia). In addition to the 21
districts of ZOI this GIS census also covers two additional districts i.e. Bandarban and Cox’s Bazar which
falls under Zone of Resilience (ZOR). Figure 1 visualizes the coverage area for this study.

        1.2 Purpose of the Mapping

The purpose of this mapping is to support Activity (program) in achieving improved relations between
aquaculture market actors and established functioning market linkages by conducting a detailed
spatial aquaculture market resource mapping using GIS in intervention site. An extensive spatial
survey covering the entire ZOI and ZOR aims to capture current situation and targets for different
actors/nodes in the Value Chain (VC). This spatial market resource mapping and market analysis aims
to identify potential gaps in input supply or market services and provide a key decision and policy tool
for management of this Activity and the aquaculture sector in the coverage areas.
One of the key targets of this mapping exercise is to make a large Global Positioning System (GPS)
enabled aquaculture market actors’ inventory which will finally help private sector or potential
investors (domestic and foreign) in their informed decision-making. This location-based inventory is
expected to add value in business intelligence of public and private investors. Integration of spatial
dataset in Management Information System (MIS) to portray geographical variation in aquaculture
market system is also desired. Linked to GIS maps this spatial database shall provide near real-time
spatial information on supplier/VC actor location, product description including their performance.
Diversified data like location information (i.e. nursery, hatchery) and specific data (i.e. the availability
of feeds dealer for certain region) has been collected to measure the differences in the resource base
or aquaculture systems between different areas within the ZOI and ZOR spatially. This geo-tagged
dataset can strongly be used as a decision making tool by playing an important role in Monitoring
Evaluation and Learning (MEL).

        1.3 Methodology

This study is mainly a census that surveyed all the major aquaculture market actors located in FTF ZOI
and ZOR. Most precisely, the study took the attempt to visualize aquaculture market system
deployment geographically. Hence, in addition to getting basic feature information the spatial
attribute data have also been collected under this initiative.
A detail process can be summarized below:

      1.3.1 Aquaculture market actors

The basic aquaculture VC actors identified and surveyed to collect information in this study are listed
below. A brief description of key actors/features is also provided in Annex. For ease of data collection
system VC actors were grouped under some feature classes. Figure 2 describes the feature class as
per the grouping structure.

    1.3.2 Census mechanism

A team of 45 people moved into the field with GPS enabled device. The entire study area was divided
into small segments i.e. village, union for survey purpose. Field team members physically visited every
single target feature and collected information including spatial data in their device. They were given
an online questionnaire loaded in their electronic device (mobile tab). For each entity the data
enumerators had to fill up some questions and simultaneously take GPS locations. All these data were
finally uploaded in the Kobo Toolbox server after certain data checking stages.

    1.3.3 Existing data collection and review

Before going to the field for data collection, ground work has been done for base map preparation.
GIS maps were collected from Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED) for
administrative boundary i.e. division, district, upazilla and union level; river polygon; forest location
and road network. GPS locations collected from field were overlaid on the LGED maps to cross check
boundary and spatial locations of the features. New locations were finally added in the base maps
after certain cross validation. Consultations were also held with International Food Policy Research


                                                                                                     Page | 6

Institute (IFPRI) to collect and review available data relevant for this aquaculture GIS resource
mapping.

         1.3.4 Field survey plan and preparation

Prior to start the GIS aquaculture market mapping, a study team was formed by positioning people at
different levels. The overall leadership and coordination task was done by MEL & GIS Specialist. For
field level convenience the survey team has been divided into some layers with designated roles and
responsibilities:
    a. There were 36 Data Enumerators (DE) who were responsible to collect data from the field. All
       these 36 DEs were divided into 04 groups named Rui, Katla, Koi and Silver having 09 DEs in
       each group.
    b. To supervise and support these DEs04 Group Supervisors (GS) were recruited. Each group (i.e.
       Ruo, Katla, Koi and Silver) has their own GS.
    c.     A planning team of 04 members has been formed to provide an effective and coordinated
          field movement plan for the groups.
    d. To provide overall guidance to the field team 01 survey supervisor has also been recruited.
Besides team formation, another major task for field survey preparation was to develop
questionnaire. MEL team divided the VC actors into some feature classes and listed key questions to
be collected. An online platform “Kobo Toolbox” was used for field survey. Data collection was done
using mobile device provided by the Activity. All the devices were loaded with electronic questionnaire
with internet enabled mobile sim card. Once ready, the mobile devices were handed over to the field
team. The digital communication platform “Slack” was used in this work has also been prepared at
this preparation stage. The details on this system will be discussed later.

         1.3.5 Training and field trial on data collection

The survey team has been provided a 3 day long residential training prior to their field movement. The
team has received an orientation on fundamental aquaculture related knowledge; market actors,
places and their functions; hands on training on data collection using electronic device and process on
GPS data collection.




                          Figure 3 Training session arranged for survey team



                                                                                              Page | 7

At the end of training, the survey team collected data as a field trial from 4 districts as of Khulna,
Satkhira, Jashore and Narail. To capture the aquaculture system diversity the first two districts were
selected from shrimp culture zone and the rest two came from fish culture zone. Survey team tested
the survey questionnaire in the field and attended refresher training. In the training, field learning and
challenges were discussed and necessary updates on questionnaire and field movement plan has been
made. Finally, survey team started their journey towards data collection.

      1.3.6 Data collection

Data collected from field was duly checked and stored in the Activity server. There was a systematic
effort to collect data from field, check at different levels and finally submit in the server. The key steps
involved in data collection process are discussed below:
    a. Questionnaire survey with location information: DEs went to the field with the questionnaire
       loaded in the mobile device and collected data from different aquaculture VC actors. There
       were lists of questions fixed for different actors in their device. The location of each VC actors
       were also taken using the GPS system of mobile tab. For example, while DEs were doing the
       questionnaire survey for any market, the GPS location of that market has also been taken
       simultaneously. Here, the maximum error for location was accepted as 10m.




            Figure 5 Data collection                         Figure 4 Taking GPS location


        There were 36 DEs who visited every location, collected information, took GPS location and
        uploaded that in the
        server. GSs were
        supporting DEs to
        make      movement
        plan in the target
        areas. They were also
        responsible to check
        field data, collect
        preliminary
        hatchery,    nursery
        and dealer location
        to support DEs and
        solve       technical
                                   Figure 6 Field movement map prepared by planning team

                                                                                                   Page | 8

        problems i.e. tab maintenance, online question portal troubleshooting. The GSs also
        performed some administrative responsibilities like checking travel bills of DEs, manage
        leave/holidays, provide logistic support etc. There was also a planning team to support field
        movement. This team planned for the entry and exit point for four groups in the working
        areas. They ensured that any feature should not be double taken (which is most common in
        the village or union borders as there is no physical demarcation of boundary in reality). This
        planning team also visited hatcheries to collect tentative nursery list, union parishad for village
        map, hotel location for accommodation, markets, Upazilla Fisheries Office and special
        features if any to support DEs. The survey supervisor maintained the communication with the
        feed dealer or other aquaculture input company to verify the information collected by DEs.
        The survey supervisor has also reserved the authority to check travel bills, approve movement
        plan, and leave of field team. He was always in close contact with the DEs, GSs and planning
        team members to learn about their challenges and take immediate steps to solve the
        problems. As a part of process monitoring system the SS also prepared a weekly field report
        and submitted to Activity MEL team.
    b. Online survey portal: As mentioned earlier, the online survey toolbox “KoBo Toolbox” was
       used for data collection from the field. The GIS team has made some customization view to
       make it more efficient. To
       minimize typing error
       during data entry, some
       tools like fixing 11 digits for
       mobile       number,      auto
       completion of some field
       etc. were also used.
        To confirm uninterrupted
        internet connection the
        survey team was provided
        internet enabled mobile
        sim. Using this service the

        internet at lowest cost with

        better connection.
    c. Focus group discussion (FGD): FGD has been conducted with the key VC actors i.e. feed dealer,
       hatchery owner, nursery owner, arotdar and depot owner. These FGDs supplemented the
       information collected during questionnaire survey that certainly helped to understand the
       potential gaps in different market nodes. Most importantly, the applicability of spatial
       information in aquaculture market system has also been discussed which provided a real
       world scenario to plan for GIS as a key decision and policy support tool.

        1.3.7 Data management

All the collected information is uploaded in the server after several steps of checking. Data cleaning,
sorting and compiling were also done by a group of data management team comprised of Data



                                                                                                  Page | 9

Management Assistant (DMA), GIS Assistant and Data Management Specialist (DMS). The entire
process can be clearly understood from the below description:
   a. Field data collection: The planning team finalized the survey area for every group and fixed a
      number of target unions against each DE. All the DEs then visited their assigned areas and
      collected information in their tab. At this stage, collected data was saved only in their device
      memory.
   b. Field level data checking and uploading in the server: At the end of each day DEs gave a final
      check of their field dataset and provided to GS for checking. The GS then thoroughly checked
      his group members’ collected information in pre developed excel checking format and
      provided feedback if any correction was needed. After GS approval, DEs uploaded their data
      in the server.
   c. Data checking by DMA: Whenever DE collected data was uploaded in the server that arrived
      in the table of DMA. She then downloaded the data set and checked the data based on the
      checking indicator. Some of the key checking criteria were:
                No of features: DMA counted to the number of features collected by per DE/day. If
                 the number was not near to average level the respective DEs were then
                 communicated for clarification.
                Mobile number: This is the most important factor for dataset as it provides the
                 identity of individuals. So, DMA checked whether the DE collected mobile number
                 of the dealers, nursery/hatchery owner etc. were actual people or not.
                Spelling error: One of the crucial issues for dataset was ensuring unique spelling for
                 common features by all. Hence, the DEs were provided a list of words which are
                 mostly common in all areas. DMA also needed to check the spelling provided by DE.
                New village: During survey, field team found some new villages which were not
                 listed. One major reason was difference in village name as known locally and written
                 in the official documents. Besides, some villages also divided in to two or more parts
                 and got a new name. DMA checked the village name with the list and took notes
                 whenever any new village was found.
                Unusual entity: Sometimes some unusual entities were observed because of typing
                 mistakes. DMA checked the information and contacted the concerned DE to recheck
                 the data.
                Data accuracy: GPS location taken by DE for each feature should have ≤10 meter
                 error. Hence, the data accuracy levels were also checked by DMA. If needed the DEs
                 were requested to recollect the data when the error became ≥10 meter.
   d. Data checking by GIS Assistant: GIS Assistant cross matched the GPS locations taken for
      individual features/places with LGED union boundary and other attribute data every day. After
      this validation field data was sent to DMA for finalization.
   e. Data compilation by DMS: After the checking done by DMA and GIS assistant when all the
      necessary corrections are made data set was sent to DMS. Afterward, the DMS finally checked
      and compiled the dataset.
   f.   Information checking by Market Information Assistant (MIA): An external data cross checking
        was also performed by MIAs of the Activity. For example, the MIA randomly took one GS’s 2
        surveyed villages from one union and cross checked that data. All the collected information

                                                                                             Page | 10

        of these villages were then rechecked by the MIA. DEs were requested to recollect the data if
        any information found wrong or not properly collected.
    g. Data verification: Hatchery information has been checked at several stages. At first, hatchery
       list was collected from hatchery association for respective region. A list was also collected
       from the upazilla level Department of Fisheries (DoF) office. Discussion was also held with the
       lead hatchery owners of every upazilla and union to know the hatchery information. DEs have
       finally visited every hatchery in the study areas and updated the list. For example, demolished
       hatchery was removed from the list and new one was added when found. The hatchery list
       was also checked with previously collected data in AIN project.
        Data verification has also been performed for nurseries. DEs have collected mobile phone
        number of every nursery during field visit. After receiving data from field, data management
        team called every nursery owner to know about their business and finally listed in the
        database.
        Dealer information collected from field has also been crosschecked. GS met the feed and
        medicine company officials in the respective regions and confirmed dealer list.

      1.3.8 Guideline using artificial intelligence

One of the important subject of this
survey was using of “artificial
intelligence”. For the survey guideline a
robot known as “G-bot” was developed.
This electronic robot was used as live
guideline of the survey questionnaire.
The objective of developing this G-bot is
to support field team by providing
                                                                                     KoBo
information anytime they needed. For                                                 Server
example, sometimes the DEs feel
confused whether they should take GPS
location for a feature or not. This
artificial intelligence G-bot can provide
answer to the question asked by the
team, which provided them an
immediate support. The entire data
collection and processing system is
shown in figure 8
.

                                                                                               Page | 11

        1.3.9 Field management and monitoring

One of the important steps of this study is to have an effective and continuous monitoring system in
place. This is done in two different ways:
    a. Process documentation: There is a system of documenting all the activities performed in the
       field. The survey supervisor is mainly responsible to deliver this report on weekly basis to the
       GIS reporting consultant. In this report the survey supervisor has documented field data
       collection process, all the field challenges, learnings, own observation etc. that helped
       monitoring team to learn from the challenges and make a more effective plan.
    b. Digital platform: An online communication and monitoring
       platform called “Slack” is used for the team to ensure that all
       the team members keep in touch and help each other
       anytime in need. GIS assistant uploaded field maps in slack
       prior to the survey so that the entire team can update
       themselves and make plan for their field movement. There
       are some specific threads where information are sent and
       stored. For example, in the dealer list thread the DEs have
       uploaded dealers’ information and that information is further
       verified by survey supervisor. In survey supervisor thread the
       survey provides field decisions/information to the DEs and
       planning team. All these activities are monitored by DMA and
       GIS specialist continuously using slack. The photos taken by
       field team were also uploaded in this platform.

      1.3.10 Duration of the study

The 10 month long field study started from December, 2018 and continued up to September, 2019.
Due to rainy season field work was stopped for two months from July-August, 2019. During that
period, the study team was engaged in data verification and checking in this interim period. The field
work again resumed from end of August and continued till end of September. This aquaculture
mapping work ended by a closing workshop organized in Cox’s bazar attended by the entire study
team.

        1.4 Findings and Analysis

This study has covered 23 districts of ZOI and ZOR. About 150 upazillas, 99 paurashavas and 1,332
unions were physically visited and surveyed by the field based survey team. The key findings of this
extensive field visit are summarized in the next section.

      1.4.1 Aquaculture support service center

The most prominent places identified in this mapping were market. There are approximately 7,414
markets found spread across the study area. Locations of union service centers were also collected

                                                                                             Page | 12

and incorporated in the spatial dataset. Around 2,100 financial institutes have been identified during
the survey. Some other major aquaculture activity pace located in this region are fish/shrimp depot,
fish/shrimp processing zone, fry sell center, dry fish processing zone, aquaculture company and so on.
The summary of these actors and their numbers are shown in table 1.

Market information has been collected in two segments as fish market and market without fish.
Interestingly, most of the markets (6,661 markets) have fish place in its territory. Among 7,414
markets only 753 markets were identified where fishes were not sold. The percentage distribution of
fish market is illustrated in figure 10.




    Figure 11 Fish market                                Figure 10 Market type-fish & without fish

In the figure 12 the geographical distribution of fish market is explained. In ZOI the highest fish markets
were found in Barishal followed by Jashore. On the other hand, in ZOR the highest numbers of fish
markets are found in Cox’s Bazar (329 fish markets).




                                                                                                Page | 13

                         Figure 12 Geographical distribution of fish market

The fish markets were again categorized by retail or wholesale. The presence of wholesale fish market
is highest in Bhola, Patuakhali, Khulna and Satkhira. These are some of the major fish culture zone in
ZOI from where fishes/shrimps are being exported outside the districts and even country. The
proportion of wholesale fish market in different districts is well illustrated in figure 13.




                      Figure 13 Regional distribution of fish wholesale market

Fish Arot is also a dominant feature in most of aquaculture business areas. Majority of the big markets
have Arots that collects fish from fisherman. Figure 14 clearly states the present status of fish market
having Arot within its amenity.

    1.4.2 Aquaculture market actors

A variety of aquaculture market actors were also identified in this mapping. Table 2 provides a
snapshot of the prominent market actors found in ZOI and ZOR for aquaculture. The detailed analysis
of these major market actors are discussed below.
Table 2 Information on aquaculture market actors

 Market actors                                                        Number of actors

 Input supplier (i.e. hormone, alcohol, oxygen, packaging etc.)            198


In aquaculture seed, feed and medicine are considered as some of the important inputs. Private
sectors have maintained a specific supply chain for these products. For example, there are 7,241
traders who supply only feed. At the same time, 1854 of total traders supply both feed and aqua
medicine. Figure 15 illustrates traders’ (dealers, sub dealers, retailers) business types in ZOI and ZOR.
This should be noted that, total supply chain maintained by different companies has also been
collected along with the GPS location under this study.

Feed mills can be classified in two categories as commercial and semi-auto/nano. Among total 153
feed mills identified in the study areas 119 are semi-auto and the rest 34 are commercial. Feed types
of these mills include floating, sinking and sometimes both. However, sinking type feed is predominant
among the feed mills.




                                    Figure 16 Semi-auto/Nano feed mill

 In the study areas most of feed mills were found in Jashore, Sathkhira and Khulna. There are about
40 feed mills in Jashore, 25 in Sathkhira and 19 in Khulna. The number of feed mills in other districts
ranges from 1- 10. The upazilla level feed mill distribution is presented in figure 17.

Diversified categories of hatcheries were found in different locations of the country. For example, in
ZOI the presence of carp, tilapia and prawn hatchery is predominant. Due to short cycle production
people are also doing climbing perch and catfish. People can get high value comparatively in shorter
period. On the other hand, in ZOR shrimp hatcheries are predominant. Presence of high salinity in
ZOR influences to flourish shrimp hatcheries. The regional concentration of hatcheries is described in
figure 18. A table is also provided in annex.




                          Figure 18 Geographical concentration of hatcheries

Nurseries are the most important aquaculture market actor point from where farmer get fingerling. A
diversified set of nurseries are observed across the ZOI and ZOR. For example, in ZOI the most common
nursery types are carp; carp & thai-puti; carp & tilapia; carp, catfish, thai-puti & tilapia etc. Shrimp and
prawn nursey is mostly found in Khulna division. One of the reasons for flourishing tilapia nursery in
ZOI is its saline tolerant capacity. So, farmers in this region are doing tilapia along with shrimp
cultivation. In contrary, the ZOR have mostly carp; carp & tilapia and catfish nursery. Detailed
information on the combination of nursery type with geographical variation is provided in annex. The
figure 19 also illustrates the concentration of nurseries across the region.

        1.5 Challenges from Field

While working in the field a numbers of challenges were faced by the team ranges from technical,
social, physical and even meteorological.

      1.5.1 Technical challenges:

There were some technical issues raised by the field staff especially at the beginning stage which was
resolved by the team accordingly. Some of the key challenges were:
             a. Finalizing unique spelling: One of the big problems faced by DMA was receiving
                 different spelling naming for a single feature. There was no spelling guideline
                 provided to field team members at the initial stage. So, DEs provided information
                 based on their knowledge and thus the spelling varied. Finally, the MEL team decided
                 to provide a spelling guide/checklist for some common features to ensure that
                 everyone using the same spelling for common features.
             b. Taking GPS Location: Some of the common technical problems for taking GPS location
                 confronted by the team was taking longer time to get GPS reading, it was hard to
                 take location at evening or during rain/cloudy weather and getting accuracy less than
                 or equal to 10 m. To minimize these problems some of the faulty tabs were replaced
                 by new one. The new tabs could take measurements within 5m accuracy level. The



                                                                                            Page | 18

                 teams were also suggested to survey at the day time that helps to get GPS location
                 more easily.
             c. Identifying features: Sometimes confusion arose while taking features information in
                 field. For example, when union parishad complex and aquaculture information
                 center were located at the same building complex, DEs became confused on whether
                 to take one location or twice for both features. Besides, in some cases DEs couldn’t
                 determine whether they should take location of the feature or not. To solve these
                 sorts of problems instructions were provided at the slack in artificial intelligence “G-
                 Bot” where DEs can ask any question or problems faced during field visit or anytime
                 they are in need.

      1.5.2 Invisible geographical boundary

The team was divided into some groups with some given target areas. For example, each DE has to
cover a certain number of unions. As the DEs were moving in the field with union/village maps,
problems arose whenever they came across to geographical boundary but in real world there is no
physical border. There was a possibility to take a location twice by two DEs surveying at the adjacent
areas. So, to tackle this problem, data were checked by field supervisor some in the field. Planning
team first defined the border zone and visited the area to identify features if available. Then the team
informed respective DEs to cover the feature during their survey. The DEs were also requested to
recheck with his nearby teammate while collecting information.

      1.5.3 Overlapping market boundary

Some of the markets in village areas fall under more than one union boundary. For example, a market
in Faridpur district covers both Gerda and Nogirkanda union. In that case it was difficult to identify the
union for which the market should be located. To solve this problem, the union from where the first
location was captured considered as the union for these overlapping markets.




                         Figure 20 Markets with overlapping union boundary

                                                                                               Page | 19

      1.5.4 Time management

All the 04 groups were given some target unions to be covered in a day. Sometimes, it was tough to
meet targets when the area appeared as heavy feature zone. In this situation team members from
nearby low feature zone were asked for support in this dense area to cover target within the time. It
was also very difficult when the distance between living station and field location was quite far away.
In that case, the teams were suggested to start field work early in the morning to cover travel time.
Planning teams have also tried to find living places for the teams nearby their field areas to reduce the
travel time.

      1.5.5 Field movement

Moving a long distance every day is another major challenge
for the team. Sometimes, the DEs have to travel 80 km a day
to cover target areas. In most cases DEs had to manage local
transportation system like motorbike or van to identify
features. However, often the DEs had to walk entire day to
visit the area where no local transportation was available.
The transportation situation was more complex in the hilly
areas. The field team members had to wait longer time to
get any suitable vehicle. After field trial in 04 districts, a
planning team was formed to locally analyze movement
planning system including accommodation, fastest route
etc. That initiative dramatically reduced the movement
problem.                                                         Figure 21 Challenging village roads

      1.5.6 Weather situation

Extreme weather situation has made the task very difficult for the field team as DEs had to physically
visit every feature location to collect
information. There are remote areas in the
ZOI and ZOR which were totally inaccessible
during rainy season. Besides, working during
high temperature made many staff physically
ill. By taking these issues into consideration it
was decided to postpone field work for two
months from June-July. The remote areas like
Phatuakhali, Bhola and Barguna regions were
covered before the rain season. To cope up
with the rain, survey supervisors also
followed regular weather forecast update by
Google every 30 minutes to make efficient
movement plan in the field.                           Figure 22 No transportation during rain




                                                                                              Page | 20

      1.5.7 Others

Mobile number of the nursery, hatchery owner, depot, dealers etc. were also collected under this
study as that provided a unique identity of every feature. So, the DEs strongly gave emphasis to collect
this information from field. However, in some cases it was challenging to get mobile number. There is
a tendency among the people not to share their mobile number publicly because they are frightened
of harassment. Unavailability of market actors during day time was also another challenge faced by
the field team as the data were mainly collected during the day time. Hence, this was a challenge as
sometimes they could not find any market actors to provide required information. This scenario was
mostly happened for nurseries, when nursery owners went out for work their family members weren’t
willing to talk to outsiders. So the team had to visit twice to get those information which required
double effort and time.

        1.6 Lessons Learned
A closing workshop was arranged in Cox’s bazar at the end of this market resource mapping work in
September 2019. Team members who involved in this work shared their learning from different
perspective from administrative to technical issues. The major learnings from the workshop and also
from field notes are summarized in the next section.

        1.6.1 Change in team plan

Initially the team was divided into 4 groups and each group was led by a group supervisor. Every 2
groups were again guided by a survey supervisor. So, there were 2 survey supervisors whose main
responsibility was to facilitate survey plan, oversee administrative issues, manage accommodation
etc. They made travel plan for their respective DEs. For huge workload, survey supervisors could not
make local movement map, which could have reduced the overlapping of DEs, working location,
finding the best route etc. For instance, one DE could cover others groups working area which is near
to him but far from the designated groups. Hence, it has been observed that the DEs had to travel long
distance that might be reduced if a coordinated plan were made. Managing accommodation for large
team at one place is also a challenge for survey supervisor especially in remote areas. Keeping that in
mind a little change in team plan has been made. Team deployed one survey supervisor who
thoroughly overseen visit plan to reduce movement time and distance. A planning team comprising
one team member from 4 groups each was also deployed to support DEs. They would then take the
responsibility to pre-visit survey area and provide information to DEs. Managing accommodation for
every group was also their responsibility. So, now the team can stay in small groups and live near to
their survey area. This reduces travel time in one hand and also provides more time for field work.

        1.6.2 Aqua-medicine dealership

It was assumed that the aqua-medicine follow the similar dealership pattern of feed supply chain.
Unfortunately, the actual scenario is totally different in real world. There is no dealership given for
aqua-medicine. Marketing officers of the medicine company visit individual farmers and shop owners
and assess their problems, produce demand to company and then finally provide the products to the
client. Sometimes, the marketing officers also provide the most wanted products to feed dealer shops
or even local retailers from where the clients buy aqua-medicine. One of the reasons of this aqua-


                                                                                              Page | 21

medicine supply chain might be the limited amount of required for fish culture compared to fish feed.
Sole dealership only for medicine may not bring much profit. More study on this issue may be taken
in future to analyze this fact.

      1.6.3 Left unions
Field staff started to visit every single union to find target features. While surveying, the team found
that there are some unions which might be left untouched as there is no necessary feature. Visiting
those areas should be wastage of time and team effort. Hence, the planning team decided to get
information of the target unions prior to survey and suggest DEs to take or avoid those unions based
on feature availability. There are about 26 unions that are not covered under this study which are
listed in annex.

      1.6.4 Field team composition

All the information of this study has been collected in mobile tab using online survey portal. So, having
technical knowledge on internet and mobile usage was mandatory. Moreover, knowledge on
aquaculture is also very important to know while taking information from the targets. Therefore, while
recruiting field staff people having technical knowledge on internet and mobile usage, experience on
working aquaculture issues, capacity to work in remote areas etc. were taken into consideration. Each
team was formed in a way so that each member can support other when required. For example, in
every team there were 01 university graduate who supported in technical troubleshooting and 01
aquaculture expertise assisted on aquaculture related issues. This team composition worked very well
during field survey.

      1.6.5 Everyday group sharing
At the end of each day the team members sat in their living station to share about their experience
with GS along with other team members. This was an excellent practice that helped each other to
learn and improve their own skill. For example, some group members were facing problems to collect
mobile number. This was because problems in communication strategy of the surveyor. While sharing
this challenge other member who was good in collecting mobile numbers shared his strategy and thus
helped each other to improve own capacity.

      1.6.6 Monthly group meeting
Generally the monthly group meeting was conducted
on 20th of each month to compile monthly bills before
the month ends. So, the field staff could get their
monthly expenditure at the end of each month. This
initiative helped the staff to work more effectively
while they received their bills in time. This monthly
meeting also gave the opportunity to meet all the
team members at a place and work on the field
challenges. Here, all the problems, successes,
learnings and findings were discussed more
                                                             Figure 23 Team members’ discussion in
responsively. The open discussion during the meeting
                                                                        monthly meeting


                                                                                              Page | 22

helped them to make a more effective work plan for next survey areas.

      1.6.7 Digital communication

Exploring “Slack” as communication platform was one of the best learnings of this study. At the
beginning of work team members mostly communicated through mobile phone calls for everyday
communication which resulted in communication gap. With this communication system team
members used to miss team decision as those were not recorded. On the other hand, it was also not
possible to bring all team members to inform about any issues immediately after the decisions are
made. Survey supervisors also faced problems to locate DEs when they were in the field. Hence, team
members were motivated to use “Slack” as their sole communication platform that made the
communication process very easy. Through that app, the decisions were posted and members could
notice immediately when it is uploaded. DEs could upload survey photos whenever they needed. Here,
all the information is kept safe and stored for future requirement.

      1.6.8 Women involvement in aquaculture market system

Even though this survey did not include gender mapping in its scope, an additional discussion with the
enumerators after completion of the survey helped identifying gender aspects with qualitative
explanations.
Contact persons as individual actors documented in the report have both men and women in the
overall aquaculture sector. However, sex based segmentation exists among the actual actors. Men
documented as contact persons in nurseries, feed ingredient sellers and hatcheries do not necessarily
reflect that the activities are operated or led by men. It is rather a reflection of the societal perception
and practice of providing men’s contact for communication purposes. Besides, whenever a contact
person found in the survey is a woman, it reflects the obviousness that the business is largely operated
or led by a woman.
Among the individual actors identified, nurseries largely have active participation of women.
Reportedly, men are enlisted as contact persons though mostly women are operating the nurseries as
a whole in Narail (Jashore) area. The same scenario is found among feed ingredient sellers even though
women are mostly operating the businesses. It has been identified that usually women operate the
units in daytime and from evening men engage. However, most of the feed ingredient selling is
transacted in daytime (done by women mostly) and during the evening they (men, mostly) usually sell
other items they have. In case of hatcheries, the businesses are mostly collaborative within the
families though market part is solely taken care of by the men.
The participation of women in aquaculture business is very few compared to men. However, some
women dealers were found in Keshobpur and Gopalganj sador. A few number of women also run
shops where aquaculture inputs are sold. One of main reasons for women to come to this business
was the absence of male household member in the family who could take the lead. Most interestingly,
women shop owners don’t feel comfortable to tell their names as property owner. Usually, they tell
her son or husband’s name as shop owner even though she owns the property.
Findings of the survey can be used to re-investigate the gender aspects in the market support service
centers as well as sex based segmentation of actors in nurseries, feed ingredient sellers and
hatcheries, retailers and depots.


                                                                                                 Page | 23

Kaliganj and Boro bajar in Shatkhira, Gopalganj Shatpar bazar, Taal toli (Shonakata union) of Barguna,
Banghmara bajar (Rajvilla Union, Bandarban), and Foltita bazar of Bagherhat can be studied to identify
potential gender aspects concerning aquaculture market. There are issues about roles women and
men are playing, differences in wages/returns of equal works between men and women at market
places. For example, in Fakirhat there is market where women get fish as return of grading fish which
they sell in a different place in the evening. Also, in Jibonnagor upazila of Chuadanga district some
women catch fish on their own and sell them at market in the evening. Women’s participation in
dealership or sub-dealership of feed are rare and the only reason for women get involved in this
business as a replacement of their expired spouses, reportedly.

    1.7. Conclusion and Recommendations

The collection and processing of this GIS enabled spatial census data for a large number of market
actors is certainly a great achievement for the Activity. This geo-tagged baseline database is capable
of making significant impact on aquaculture market system improvement by successful application of
the information collected. However, the success mostly depends on the availability and usability of
this database; hence, some recommendations are suggested mostly on its applicability:
    a. This spatial database targets a wider range of actors each with their own purposes. For
       example, some users of feed companies may only need to locate the point from where the
       demand has been generated. Whereas, some input seller may desire to integrate this location
       data with road infrastructure or regional weather forecast before planning for any shipment.
       Therefore, a platform is needed that can support targeted user groups each with their own
       requirements, knowledge and preferred tools. So, in first case for the above mentioned
       examples a web interface to visualize the location map is well enough to fulfill user demand.
       However, for the second case it is needed to offer data integration and spatial analysis support
       in the platform. Hence, this interactive platform should consider which communities and which
       purposes they want to be served and make appropriate choices for their approach.
    b. There is an issue of data safety as a bulk amount of information has been captured in this
       census. Great care should be taken for personally identifiable information for the management
       and security of such information.
    c. Spatial attributes may change over time, since market is dynamic space and it is market
       resource map. For example, the number of input sellers of any location may change in a course
       of time or any Arot may stop running its business. So, this is important to capture a time-series
       of data within the attribute of the spatial database. A system should be in place to keep this
       database up to date.
    d. One of the major challenges would be availing GIS expertise in the target user groups. Private
       firms may feel uncomfortable to use this dataset in their everyday business due to lack of
       capacity in handling GIS software. The Activity should encourage its stakeholders to include
       GIS/spatial information in their MIS considering the massive significance of this system. They
       may also offer initial stage training for the beginners to handle the dataset.
    e. There is certainly some cost involvement in managing this spatial dataset that includes
       purchasing GIS software, regular updating of the system, recruiting GIS expertise etc. So, The
       Activity should plan for a sustainable management system to ensure that the huge census data
       collected for the benefit of wider aquaculture community is not lost when this project ends.

                                                                                              Page | 24

       Private sectors may consider using open source GIS software to cut the cost for software
       management. It may also think of introducing some user fee while providing access to this
       dataset.

                       Section 2: GIS Data Application in Aquaculture

    2.1. Application of GIS in Aquaculture Market Resource Mapping

GIS is becoming an integral part of natural resource management actions worldwide. This is often the
case that GIS is used for site selection that incorporates physical and biological parameters along with
geospatial infrastructure. Thailand and Sri Lanka were facing problems for disease outbreak in shrimp
and salmon farms which was undoubtedly been minimized by careful site selection procedure using
GIS (Seekao and Pharino, 2016; Datta, 2013; Dahdouh-Guebas et al, 2002). Hawaii has also integrated
a range of physical, environmental, and social factors with careful input and consideration of local
population concerns and cultural practices for aquaculture siting (Puniwai et al, 2014). Despite the site
selection process the essential usefulness of GIS however, lies in its ability to analyze and overlay data
in diversified ways to run different analytical functions that could contribute to a faster and more
efficient decision making process in aquaculture (Datta, 2013).
Besides aquaculture and natural resource management, GIS has become an important supportive and
enabling technology within the business environment and especially within the sphere of business
intelligence (BI) (Posthumus, 2008). To support the analytical process, today's business organizations
deploy data management system and spatial tools such as access, visualize, and analyze their
integrated, aggregated and summarized data (Rivest et al, 2005). Having a flourishing aquaculture
market system with lucrative private investment opportunity Bangladesh is expected to have a strong
data management system. Unfortunately, there is a significant data gap for aquaculture market
practices in Bangladesh. Private investors always struggle to get actual information on market
dynamics like entry point, strengths, weaknesses, competitiveness etc. So, it is expected that this
market resource census will generate a Big Data system for aquaculture and minimize the existing
data gap.
This study has collected a range of digital geo-referenced data which could produce maps and other
textual, graphical and tabular outputs for scientific investigations, resource management, and
development planning. The data set can be used as analytic tool for investment and can be integrated
with business MIS for geographical visual representation of their business. Some of the important uses
of this spatial database are discussed below in detail:

      2.1.1 Business support tool

The information generated in GIS would be essential to assess market situation at different levels of
aquaculture operation. A diverse range of information can be successively integrated within GIS to
generate outcomes that are potentially useful for economic and market analysis. The visualization
benefits along with other analytical functions have made this spatial tool more beneficial for
aquaculture business. For example, fish feed companies usually depends on demands generated by
dealers while sending products to any region. Sometimes, a delay in shipments may bring considerable
amount of losses to companies when other feed companies take the opportunity to get into the
market well ahead. The situation might not have happened if the feed companies had a spatial

                                                                                               Page | 25

database showing region specific feed information for the previous years. So that they could make a
projection of feed demand and deliver their products to those markets in time. This database also
provide region wise nursery and hatchery information which help companies to understand the
specific types of feed required for different region and thus plan accordingly in advance. Feed
companies will be more benefited when integrate this data with their MIS. An example is described in
figure 24 that uses GIS data to show transaction of the traders geographically. One can easily
understand the variation of trader’s type in different region and can take business plan for the
company.




                             Figure 24 Feed traders transaction profile

The location along with product information of nurseries and hatcheries can also be shown in the
spatial maps. This might be an important decision support tools in aquaculture business. From the

                                                                                          Page | 26

data it was revealed that on average every hatchery serves 121 nurseries in FTF ZOI. But in Gopalganj,
Rajbari, Faridpur, Shariatpur, Narail and Magura hatcheries have served 150-327 nurseries. This means
that there is a chance of hatchery improvement in the area. Using a GIS app hatcheries may easily
know the location and types of products required in the nurseries of their targets. So, they may
produce products as per market demand and supply to the market in time.

      2.1.2 Making investment plan

GIS bridge the data gap to provide a total view of business. Spatial analysis allows business users to
explore and analyze geographic and business data by combining analytical power of databases with
the geographic capabilities of maps and thereby add better informed perspective on investment plan.
Investors may segment target groups, understand competitors’ geographical domination and analyze
market segmentation depending on real data. For example, the GIS dataset shows that the areas
where Mega feed doesn’t have any traders are captured by Victor Feed to expand their business (see
figure 25). So, companies like Victor Feed may perform this sort of spatial analysis while making any
investment plan for any region.




                                   Figure 25 Market gap analysis

Spatial data integration in the existing MIS may provide valuable insights allowing the company to
maximize revenue from existing resources and also improve operational efficiency. Merging GIS into
the planning process produces results that simply visualize data on a map which take less time to
evaluate and are easier to understand. For example, figure 26 shows the recent marketing project of
MEGA Feed which mainly plots their Mega Feed School location. If they integrate the data set with
their MIS they can monitor geographically performance of their new investment. Another example
can be given for proximity analysis to ice factory and wholesale market. Ice factories needs to be
located adjacent to wholesale market to ensure the availability of ice supply for fish preservation,

                                                                                            Page | 27

packaging and supply. So, a proximity analysis was performed to understand the location of ice
factories within 10m buffer of wholesale markets. Figure 27 shows that many wholesale markets in
Patuakhali, Jashore and Bagerhat don’t have any ice factories within 10m buffer zone. In many cases
ice factories are in 15-17 km away from wholesale markets. Based on this analysis investors may assess
the demand of ice factories in the scarce zone and plan for new investments.

                                                                                            Page | 28

      2.1.3 Administrative regulations

Spatial correlations could be used to attribute data from the GIS data layer with satellite imagery to
identify the locations potential for aquaculture development. For example, government may decide
to establish an aquaculture support/research center where the highest concentration of aquaculture
farm/activities exists. This spatial database collects information on aquaculture along the entire
market system i.e. farms, feed companies, hatcheries, nurseries etc. So, while merging this
information with satellite image a suitable location that offers the best support to the existing
aquaculture functions will appear. Government may run different models in GIS to fulfill the criteria
for research/support center location like the center should be located in the city center having good
access to fish farm or center should be near to the fish hatcheries. Models will then calculate the
provided criteria from the given database and provide the best suitable location that matches with
government requirement. The resulting site and background information can be potentially used in
understanding aquaculture in the context of aquaculture spatial planning and management
objectives.




       Figure 28 Maps showing city center with road connection to hatcheries and nurseries

                                                                                            Page | 29

In addition to that, decision makers also easily take control over the unnecessary/unplanned
expansion of aquaculture activities in certain region as the information is available with spatial
attributes. If it is observed that increasing growth of fish farm/hatcheries/nurseries in any specific
region may bring less profit to aquaculture business, government may then spatially analyze the
growth pattern with real time information and impose control over expansion. In a similar way,
government may also provide support to boost up aquaculture activities in any region where this
business may bring more profit.
This spatial database also offers a great opportunity to the big companies who sale feed or other
aquaculture inputs to plan for their business. They can identify the location along with other detail
information of aquaculture pattern of any region and thus plan for distributing their dealership across
the region. This administrative decision is very much helpful for the companies to ensure optimum
use of their human and financial resources.

      2.1.4 Infrastructure support

The significance of GIS technology is that it adds a new level of functionality to query and analyze
information on infrastructure assets based on their location and spatial relationships to other features
with visual information that facilitates better and faster decision-making. This spatial decision support
system allows a decision maker to build relations between different types of data, merge multiple
data layers, get weighted outcome from potentially competing alternatives and also forecast for new
planning initiatives. For instance, aquaculture product manufacturing companies may desire to
perform a route analysis for their product shipment across a region. It is possible for this analysis to
link GIS to a model that predicts shortest distance that a vehicle should travel from origin to
destination, travel time and route plan based on vehicle and product category. This model can be
linked to region wise product demand and thus make an effective shipment plan. An arbitrary example
can be drawn here to portray this model, company A located in Khulna received product demand from
point B and C. Travel distance from A to C is 60 km. At the same time company A also received another
demand from point D and E. Distance from A to E is 25 km. Please see figure 29 for reference.




                  Figure 29 Map showing product demand from different locations

So, if company A decides to deliver products separately from A to B & C and A to D & E, the total travel
distance would be 85 km. Instead of making separate trip whenever the company performs route


                                                                                               Page | 30

analysis they may find that sum of travel distance from A to C and A to E is greater than A-D-E-B-C
single trip. Total travel time would be then only 60 km covering all the stations. The companies then
may decide to make a single shipment for both the regions which certainly save travel time and cost.
Please see figure 30 given below.




                        Figure 30 Route analysis to deliver product at different location


This spatial database can also be potentially used at field level by the farmers. If the farmers could
have the easy access of this spatial information collected in this study by simple mobile based app
then they can use this lucrative database for their fish business i.e. finding suitable fish market for
better price with route plan, selecting travel mode and estimating travel cost, identifying input dealers
etc. Thus, GIS offers the opportunity to the stakeholders to examine their own assets, compare among
alternative solutions and take an informed decision.

      2.1.5 Establish local, regional and national database

GIS allows for a regular flow of spatially related information in a standardized format and easy and
immediate integration of large data sets. Aquaculture information at varied degree from small
nurseries to big industries at small village to country level could be easily stored and analyzed in GIS.
One can easily get any information
by just clicking in the map. Figure 31
is showing a list of attribute data
spatially visualized in GIS. Its
visualization experiments with
almost infinite range of potential
graphic displays allowing maps to be
customized to suit situations and
individuals or tasks i.e. farmers to
locate markets to sell product or
depot to preserve fish, industries to
target communities to sell inputs,
governments           to      regulate
aquaculture zoning etc. The display
of spatial data in elaborative map as
output is self-explanatory and easily
                                                     Figure 31 Attribute data visualization

                                                                                               Page | 31

comprehensible to most people that make spatial analysis more preferable over other database
management system. Hence, the use of GIS greatly improves aquaculture productivity by applying
improved spatial monitoring and analysis techniques eventually take better and more effective
management practices.

      2.1.6 Data usage by Government

There is always a data gap persisted at Government level that strikes policy level decision making. To
overcome this data lacking Bangladesh Government has taken several steps. For example, there is a
website on agricultural marketing from where a variety of information i.e. product price, relevant
government development initiatives, product information etc. are made publicly available and easily
accessible. A snapshot of the website is added in figure 32. Similar to this database platform a unique
website can also be developed for aquaculture with the information collected by this aquaculture
market resource mapping. This may help Government to spatially visualize the challenges as well as
amenities and thus get data support while planning for development actions.

      2.1.7 Support on Activity management decisions

The Activity will be mostly benefitted by integrating this spatial dataset with its own MIS. The real time
data ensure that it reaches the right people at the right time to implement the program interventions.
For instance, this market resource mapping reveals that there are 06 feed companies that mostly
dominates the feed business in FTF ZOI and FTF ZOR. They have the highest market reach through
their supply chain. However, their capacity to meet farmers demand is not adequate. In addition to
these big companies there are also some small and mid-level companies who can meet farmers
demand with some quality concern. All these locations are available in geotagged real time database
that can visualize partner details with area coverage in maps. So, while selecting prospective partners
for Activity, this spatial dataset will be an asset. Figure 33 illustrates the geographical coverage of a
company called Prameeda Enterprise. One can see the difference in concentration in two areas called
Gopalganj and Sathkhira.

                                                                                  Coverage

In a nutshell, the applicability of GIS in aquaculture decision making is not limited to these above
mentioned functions only. Spatial data is capable of providing insights into the information
infrastructure needed to capture and dynamically explore the aquaculture market system and support
new analytics. GIS has the ability to locate big data sources in a faster way by tying many internal and
external data points together through location. In effect the GIS enhance data management system
to a true “one stop data access point”. Through this report some attempts have been taken to
showcase some examples for spatial analysis in current aquaculture practices and encourage
stakeholders to integrate GIS in their decision support system.

    2.2 Way Forward

The success of this extensive aquaculture market resource mapping largely depends on its scalability
and ability to reach to a wider audience. This spatial dataset is expected to evolve as a planning tool
that can provide a comprehensive total view of market system and gain a real competitive advantage
for the aquaculture market actors. Thereby, some initial plans are proposed to take this work forward:
    a. At first stage, this is planned to organize a workshop in WorldFish to officially acknowledge
       this dataset. Decision needs to be taken to ensure that this dataset is updated on regular basis.
       A monitoring and budgetary plan should be in place.
    b. To ensure the sustainability of this spatial dataset, collaboration with government is must.
       Government body like DoF and other aquaculture research organization needs to be informed
       about the usage and application of this aquaculture market resource mapping. This is



                                                                                              Page | 33

   expected that the entire dataset will be handed over to DoF for wider scalability. A handover
   strategy thus needs to be developed.
c. The successful application of this information rich geospatial dataset depends on the
   acceptability by all diversified segments of aquaculture market actors. For example, one
   hatchery may identify new growth opportunities for its business. Similarly, feed company may
   find internal and external market potential to achieve sales targets. GIS is capable of
   performing these analyses by presenting data on map. As a new data analysis perspective
   market actors may need rigorous motivation to introduce this spatial data as their major
   decision support tool. Therefore, a comprehensive work plan including advertising the
   functionality of GIS data, making communication material, arranging workshops and seminars
   with market actors etc. needs to be prepared.
d. This market resource mapping can be an excellent source of information for market research
   as well. Private investors may visually and geographically identify promising customer
   segments for marker analysis by collaborating market place and actor information with spatial
   data. Hence, to introduce the diversified functionalities of this data resource workshop,
   seminar and training will be arranged for the private investors.
e. GIS is exceptionally good in providing real-time result by extracting values from all the data
   with intuitive maps that take less time to evaluate and are easier to understand. So, bringing
   this GIS intelligence to wider community a user-friendly app or online platform are planned to
   be developed.

  Annex 1 Description of key features

Feature             Description
Market              The details of the market where aquaculture products i.e. fish and other inputs
                    are bought/sold are listed here. The surveyor take information about market
                    name, location, market type, no. of open days etc.
Hatchery            A fish hatchery is a "place for artificial breeding, hatching and rearing through
                    the early life stages of fish species”.
Nursery             Nursery is a “pond farm where young fish are raised for subsequent transfer to
                    fish farms, where market weight is attained.” Nurseries whose sole purpose is
                    to sell young fish are only considered for this census. The GPS locations were
                    collected to find out the access point of grow out fish farmers for their fry or
                    fingerling.
Fish arot           A fish arot is a place where arotdar (owner) conducts auction to sell fish and
                    receives commission from the fish producers/fishermen.
Shrimp/Fish Depot Shrimp depot is an establishment for buying and selling shrimps. Shrimps are
                  stored temporarily before sending it to the fish/shrimp processing company. A
                  shrimp depot is a business establishment. That’s why it is usually seen that
                  shrimp depots have rooms, signboards and freezer/ice boxes to store shrimps.
                  Fish depots have some permanent establishment and staff to collect fish from
                  farmers, process and send to the industry.
Godighor            It is a kind of place where large amount fishes are bought from the fishermen
                    without having any auction. Those fishes are temporarily stored in the godighar
                    and finally sent to the big cities. Godighar is usually seen in the riverside areas
                    like Barishal. This is not a widely seen feature across the region. However,
                    census team collected these data for further research purpose by the
                    practitioners.
Feed Mill           An establishment that produces feed for the fish/aquaculture. Feed mills were
                    categorized under two broad head: commercial and semi-auto/Nano feed mills.
Dealer              Dealers are the direct agent of the company who works to deliver company
                    product to the people. A dealer operates under an authorization to sell or
                    distribute the company’s products in a particular area. This study aims to
                    collect the entire dealer information for feed, input, seed and aquamedicine in
                    the project locations.
Sub-Dealer          The person or organization that buys products from dealers and sells to the
                    retailers is called a sub- dealer.
Retailers           The person or organization those collect products from dealers, sub dealers or
                    company and sell to consumer in retail price.

Feature             Description
Feed Ingredient     The feed ingredient seller sells ingredients those are used to produce fish feed.
Seller              The ingredients may like Oil cake (Khoil),Bran (Kura or Vushi) etc. which are
                    directly or indirectly related to fish feed production.
Hormone and         These suppliers usually supply various kinds of chemicals such as hormone,
Alcohol Suppliers   alcohol for hatching fish.
Fry Sell Center     Fry Sells center is a particular place where fry and fingerlings of different sizes
                    are sold in pots or in ‘hapa’. There might be a signboard or a room for a fry sells
                    center depending on the place.
Fish/ Shrimp        These companies refine and process fish/shrimp to export in foreign countries
Processing          (sometimes sell in domestic market). Fish/ shrimp are usually collected from
Company             agents or depots.
Fish Landing        After catching fish from the sea or river (or sometimes pond) fishermen gather
Center              their boats in a certain place to unload. That particular place is called fish
                    landing center. From this place fishes are supplied to the markets.
Dry Fish            This is the place where different types of fishes are dried up by using sunlight
Processing Zone     and heat. Dried fish are then sent all over the country from this zone. Dry fish
                    processing zone is an important point of interest to feed mills owners. They
                    collect feed ingredients (fish meal) from this processing zone.
Transport Stand     A specific place where various types of transports are made available to
                    transport fish from one place to another. Transport stands are usually found
                    near wholesale fish markets.

Annex 8 Some examples from field notes

Case study 1: Geolocation Errors
A large number of point feature has been found outside the corresponding union boundary. Most of
those points are categorically ‘No Feature’. Except those features, a large number of point unmatched
point features based on their geolocation with their Union attribute are “Market place’ in nature. In
this case, the geolocation of the unmatched point features are not matching their Union boundary in
the maps, provided by the LGED, with their specific attribute columns in which their Union name is
being provided by the surveyors. To find out the reason, a number of unmatched market place have
been visited to find out the underlying issues for not matching their geolocation. It has been found
that, the market places are usually located at the joining point of two or more number of villages which
cover more than a single union area. That means, a single market place is situated on the boundary
lines of more than one union boundary usually. And, the DE s are commanded to use his surveyed
Union name in these cases to avoid the redundancy in the database for a single market place. As
example, the Mahila Road Bazar can be used. This single market place is located into the borders of
three different Union namely, Gerda union under the Faridpur Upazilla and Talma and Ramnagar
Unions under the Nagarkanda Upazilla. This Unions are being divided by a bridge named Jamtola
Bridge only. So, the point features of the market places taken from this market having the union name
of Gerda as attribute data, showing its location into the boundary of Talma Union.



Case Study 2: Port Road Fish Market
The official Name Of this Market is Rasulpur
Paikari Motsho Arot. Some people called it as
Zia Fish Market. After Mohipur and Fatorghata
Fish Market, this is the Biggest Wholesale Fish
Market in Barisal Division. This Market is consist
of 120 fish arot ,70 Fish Wholesaler and around
80 fish retailer. About, 1500 to 2000 People

there are 3 different BMO institutions which
belongs to wholesale, arotdar, and the labours

retailer observed in BMO. There is more than 50
labours who lead their livelihood pattern in
seasonal variation. Though they are not registered but they have strong relation with the wholesaler,
retailer and so on. It has created the transportation facilities through truck, pickup and so on.

Case Study 4: The fish traders are ignorant of the production of pona fish in the Dhaoa
Union
There is no fish nursery at Dhaoa Union
which is a part of Bhandaria upazila,
Pirojpur. There is a lot of patilwala
working in this union. They supply fish
pona from Jashore, Khulna to the traders
living here. But in this area, there are
plenty of ponds to produce fish which
can be developed as nursery. These
ponds are very useful for pona fish and
the pond environment is very useful for
pona fish production but people here do
not have any knowledge about fish
nursery. But it is a matter of great news
that the people here have expressed
interest in producing pona fish, and
especially one person said that he will
take training on producing pona and at
