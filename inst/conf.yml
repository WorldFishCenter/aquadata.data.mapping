      ### Welcome to the CGIAR metadata explorer!


      The CGIAR metadata explorer is part of **[aquadata.data.mapping](https://github.com/WorldFishCenter/aquadata.data.mapping)**, a repository developed to to collect metadata within the context aquatic food systems in order to identify data gaps and generate new data in key geographic region: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, India, Myanmar, Nigeria, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste and Zambia.

      **aquadata.data.mapping** uses metadata information to download data and elaborate data stories and scientific reports' summaries using AI tools (ChatGPT).

      The repository is part of work package 1 "***AquaData***" of the initiative "***Resilient Aquatic Food Systems for Healthy People and Planet***" (<https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/121141> ).
