        The relationship between phytoplankton cell size and abundance has long been known to follow regular,
        predictable patterns in near steady-state ecosystems, but its origin has remained elusive. To explore the
        linkage between the size-scaling of metabolic rate and the size abundance distribution of natural phyto-
        plankton communities, we determined simultaneously phytoplankton carbon fixation rates and cell
        abundance across a cell volume range of over six orders of magnitude in tropical and subtropical
        waters of the Atlantic Ocean. We found an approximately isometric relationship between carbon fixation
        rate and cell size (mean slope value: 1.16; range: 1.03– 1.32), negating the idea that Kleiber’s law is appli-
        cable to unicellular autotrophic protists. On the basis of the scaling of individual resource use with cell
        size, we predicted a reciprocal relationship between the size-scalings of phytoplankton metabolic rate
        and abundance. This prediction was confirmed by the observed slopes of the relationship between phy-
        toplankton abundance and cell size, which have a mean value of 21.15 (range: 21.29 to 20.97),
        indicating that the size abundance distribution largely results from the size-scaling of metabolic rate.
        Our results imply that the total energy processed by carbon fixation is constant along the phytoplankton
        size spectrum in near steady-state marine ecosystems.
