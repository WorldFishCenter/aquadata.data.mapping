The goal of **aquadata.data.mapping** is to collect and analyse metadata within the context aquatic food systems in order to identify and eventually fill data gaps in key geographic region: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, India, Myanmar, Nigeria, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste and Zambia.

This repository is part of work package 1 "***AquaData***" of the initiative "***Resilient Aquatic Food Systems for Healthy People and Planet***" (<https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/121141> ).

## To get started

Install and load the R package from the most recent version using the following commands on the R console:

```{r}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("WorldFishCenter/aquadata.data.mapping")
library(aquadata.data.mapping)
```

## Explore the data

Once installed, you can access and explore the data directly from the package. `dataverse_metadata` include metadata information on the data of several CGIAR organizations, while `worldfish_guestbook_responses` include information provided by the users downloading WorldFish data.

```{r}
# Summary of dataverse_metadata 
dplyr::glimpse(dataverse_metadata)

# CGIAR organizations
unique(dataverse_metadata$organization)

# Summary of worldfish_guestbook_responses 
dplyr::glimpse(worldfish_guestbook_responses)
```

You can filter the data using the `filterby_word` function and show the first 10 rows:

```{r}
filtered_metadata <- filterby_word(word = "Bangladesh")
head(filtered_metadata)
```
